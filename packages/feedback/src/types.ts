/**
 * The shape of Tier 1 authored teaching copy.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md, "Feedback: every step explains itself, and almost none of it costs
 * a token": Tier 1 is the named cause plus copy that says what the student did,
 * why it is wrong, and what to look at instead. Written once, reviewed once,
 * served forever, zero tokens. This file is the contract that copy is written
 * against.
 *
 * Three fields, not one paragraph, for two reasons. A renderer needs to show
 * them separately, because "what to look at instead" is the part a student reads
 * first when they are stuck and the part they reread when they are not. And a
 * reviewer needs to be able to check the three jobs independently, because copy
 * that explains the chemistry beautifully and then ends with "try again" has
 * failed at exactly one of them.
 *
 * chem-core's `CauseDefinition` already carries `summary` and `teaches`. Those
 * are the engine's own short description of the cause, sized for a log line or a
 * validator report. This is the student facing version and it is longer, is
 * addressed to the person who made the attempt, and is the thing a human
 * reviewer signs off. The two are deliberately separate: chem-core must never
 * depend on this package, and rewriting student copy must never mean editing
 * engine code.
