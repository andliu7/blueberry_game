/**
 * Named causes. A first class registry, not a free string.
 *
 * This file is the feedback win condition made into data. CLAUDE.md records that
 * the bar shows one thing when a student is wrong, a yellow triangle, and that
 * closing that gap is measured by "count of distinct named failure causes" and
 * "percentage of wrong attempts resolving to a named cause rather than a generic
 * failure". Both of those are counts over this registry. A free string cannot be
 * counted, cannot be grouped, cannot be translated, and cannot be tested for
 * coverage, so `NamedCause` carries a `CauseId` from a closed union and any
 * detail it needs as structured references.
 *
 * `CauseId` is written out as a union and the registry is typed
 * `Record<CauseId, CauseDefinition>`. That means adding a member to the union
 * without adding its definition is a compile error, and adding a definition
 * without a union member is also a compile error. The count reported by
 * `causeCount()` is therefore the real number, not the number somebody
 * remembered to update.
 *
 * A cause never contains a rendered sentence. `summary` and `teaches` are the
 * copy, and they live next to the id so a writer can improve the wording without
 * touching any engine code.
