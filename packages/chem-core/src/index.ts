/**
 * @blueberry/chem-core
 *
 * The mechanism engine's data model. Pure TypeScript. No React, no DOM, no
 * rendering, no `three`, no RDKit, and no dependencies at all.
 *
 * What is in here, in the order it is worth reading:
 *
 *   ids.ts          Identifier aliases, and the invariant that atom ids are
 *                   stable across a step. Read this first.
 *   elements.ts     The element table. Formal charge is derived from it.
 *   atom.ts         Atoms and tetrahedral geometry. No CIP, ever.
 *   bond.ts         Bonds and double bond geometry. Orders 1, 2, 3 only.
 *   species.ts      One connected molecule or ion.
 *   state.ts        A multiset of species, and spectator declarations.
 *                   This is the system boundary rule.
 *   arrows.ts       Declared electron flow: source, sink, count.
 *   routes.ts       The names of routes, elementary steps, transformations.
 *   step.ts         AXIS ONE. What a step is.
 *   causes.ts       The named cause registry. Countable by construction.
 *   resolution.ts   AXIS TWO. What an attempt resolved to.
 *   bookkeeping.ts  Counters for mass, charge, and electrons. Not checks.
 *   deltas.ts       What the arrows claim, and what the states show, computed
 *                   separately so comparing them means something.
 *   edit.ts         Immutable structural edits.
 *
 * Three things this package deliberately does not do, each with the reason
 * written at the top of the file that would otherwise host it:
 *
 *   It does not compute CIP descriptors. RDKit does, in CI, and the label is
 *   copied in at authoring time. See atom.ts and VERIFICATION.md S4.
 *
 *   It does not perceive aromaticity or canonicalise structures. That is
 *   Indigo's job and RDKit's job. See D3 in docs/INHERITED-DECISIONS.md.
 *
 *   It does not compute the product of a step from its arrows. If it did, the
 *   arrows would agree with the product by construction and the check that they
 *   agree would be checking nothing. See arrows.ts.
