/**
 * Where a problem sits in the syllabus, and how hard it is.
 *
 * Three closed unions with typed record registries, the same construction
 * chem-core's causes.ts uses and for the same reason: a topic written as a free
 * string cannot be counted, cannot be grouped for mastery, and cannot be checked
 * for coverage. `CourseId`, `TopicId` and `ConceptId` are unions, `TOPICS` and
 * `CONCEPTS` are typed `Record<Id, Definition>`, so a member of the union with no
 * definition is a compile error and a definition outside the union is one too.
 *
 * THE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY II TREE IS NOW REAL. `docs/COURSE-OUTLINE-ORGO2.md` is
 * the authoritative structure and this file is its executable half. Everything
 * under `orgo_2` below traces to a numbered section of that document, including
 * every prerequisite edge. Where that document and CLAUDE.md disagree, CLAUDE.md
 * wins; section 9 of the document lists the conflicts found.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CARRIES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It carries topics, which is the
 * granularity a `Problem` is filed at, plus the prerequisite edge list and the
 * cross cutting concepts. It does NOT carry the subtopic and skill layer below a
 * topic. That layer exists, it is section 3 of the outline, and it stays in the
 * document until there is a lesson schema to register it in. The argument in the
 * paragraph above applies one level down as hard as it applies here: a skill
 * written as a free string in an array is a skill nobody can count. It becomes
 * `LessonId` with a registry of this same shape, and not before.
 *
 * THREE MODELLING DECISIONS WORTH THE READ, because each one was a judgement call
 * and each is reversible only with an argument:
 *
 *   PREREQUISITES ARE DEPENDENCIES, NOT DELIVERY ORDER. The source course opens
 *   its alcohol block immediately after its spectroscopy block, and opens its
 *   benzene block on leftover Diels-Alder practice. Both are facts about a
 *   timetable. Neither is encoded as an edge, because the placement quiz walks
 *   this graph backwards to decide where a struggling student starts, and
 *   answering "you failed epoxides, go back and do NMR" is a wrong answer. The
 *   outline records both under section 4 and says they are not encoded.
 *
 *   THE CROSS ACT LINKS ARE CONCEPTS, NOT EDGES. Kinetic versus thermodynamic
 *   control is taught on dienes in Act 1 and re-tested on enolates in Act 3. That
 *   is a real link and it is not a prerequisite: a student can learn enolate
 *   chemistry without diene chemistry. It lives in `CONCEPTS`, which is a
 *   separate relation with its own `introducedIn` and `reusedIn`, so a diagnostic
 *   can say "this is the same idea you met on dienes" without the unlock graph
 *   gating one behind the other.
 *
 *   THE EPOXIDE ORDERING FIX. `epoxides` depends on
 *   `nucleophiles_and_leaving_groups`, a deliberately lightweight node, and NOT
 *   on `nucleophilic_addition_carbon`. The source course opens epoxides with
 *   Grignard reagents and acetylides two weeks before it formally teaches them on
 *   carbonyls. A graph built from "where is this reagent first formally taught"
 *   produces the edge `nucleophilic_addition_carbon -> epoxides`, which inverts
 *   two weeks of the course and gates the whole opening of Act 1 behind Act 2.
 *   See outline section 4.
