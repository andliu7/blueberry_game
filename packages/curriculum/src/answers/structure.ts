/**
 * Predict the product: comparing a submitted structure against an authored one.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE USING IT, because what it does not do matters more than what
 * it does.
 *
 * WHAT IT COMPARES. Constitution, over a multiset of species. Which atoms are
 * present, including implicit hydrogens and isotope labels, what charge and how
 * many lone pairs and unpaired electrons each carries, and which atoms are bonded
 * to which at what order. Atom ids and species ids are NOT compared: a student
 * who drew the same molecule with different ids drew the same molecule. Roles are
 * not compared either, because labelling a species "byproduct" rather than
 * "product" is not a chemistry error. Declared spectators are excluded, which is
 * chem-core's own system boundary rule applied unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT COMPARE, and what it does instead of guessing:
 *
 *   Stereochemistry. If either side carries an atom or bond stereo declaration,
 *   the comparison returns UNDECIDED and names
 *   `structure_comparison_needs_stereochemistry`. It does not fall back to
 *   comparing constitution and calling that a match, because a checker that
 *   silently ignores stereochemistry marks the enantiomer correct, and CLAUDE.md
 *   is explicit that SN2 inverting is a hard assertion. problem.ts refuses to
 *   BUILD a structure problem whose authored answer carries stereo, so an author
 *   finds this out at import time rather than a student finding it out mid
 *   attempt.
 *
 *   Canonical SMILES, and everything downstream of it: tautomers, resonance
 *   forms, aromatic perception. CLAUDE.md D3 gives canonical structure
 *   equivalence to Indigo, which is already loaded on the editor routes and must
 *   stay behind the lazy boundary, and gives aromaticity to RDKit in CI. A
 *   Kekule structure with the double bonds drawn the other way round is a
 *   different graph and this file will report it as an isomer. That is a real
 *   limitation and the corpus works around it by not authoring structure answers
 *   where it bites.
 *
 *   Conformation. Declared torsions are ignored. Two conformers of one molecule
 *   are one molecule here.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A NODE BUDGET. Graph isomorphism has no known polynomial
 * algorithm and the search below is a backtracking one. CLAUDE.md's interaction
 * budget is under 100 ms from interaction to visual feedback, so the search
 * counts the nodes it visits and returns UNDECIDED rather than blocking a
 * student's phone. On the molecules this corpus contains it is not close to the
 * ceiling; the ceiling exists so that a pathological authored problem degrades
 * into a report rather than a hang.
 *
 * WHY THE MATCH DIRECTION IS VERIFIED. A "not isomorphic" answer follows from an
 * invariant that differs, which is sound on its own. An "isomorphic" answer
 * carries a bijection, and `verifyMapping` re-checks every atom and every atom
 * pair against it in linear time. So the expensive half of this file can be
 * wrong without the answer being wrong: a bug in the search makes it slow or
 * makes it report undecided, and cannot make it report a match that is not one.
