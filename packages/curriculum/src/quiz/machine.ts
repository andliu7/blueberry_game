/**
 * The placement quiz, as a pure reducer.
 *
 * A student sits real problems before signup and lands on a course
 * recommendation with a starting frontier in the pathway. Same discipline as
 * the interaction package's machine: no clock read inside a decision (elapsed
 * time arrives as event data from the shell), no randomness (every tie breaks
 * deterministically, and a caller wanting variety supplies a seed), and the
 * same three inputs always produce the same output.
 *
 * THE WALK. Ask at the student's claimed course, middle difficulty. A correct
 * answer moves the probe forward through the course's topics in registry
 * order, which placement.ts keeps dependency sound. A wrong answer walks the
 * failed topic's prerequisite closure backwards, nearest gap first, which is
 * exactly what prerequisiteClosure() is for: the next question is about the
 * closest thing the student might be missing.
 *
 * THE BOUND, which is the design and not an afterthought. The Budgets row is
 * under 180 seconds to a recommendation. The machine stops asking when the
 * reported elapsed time plus a per kind worst case reserve for the next
 * question would cross the budget, or at the hard cap of QUESTION_CAP
 * questions, whichever comes first. Unbounded adaptivity is how a quiz runs
 * long; this one cannot.
 *
 * WHAT AN EIGHT QUESTION QUIZ CAN KNOW, said honestly. The recommendation
 * carries a confidence that is "low" unless the walk actually converged, and
 * the copy never presents a fundamentals placement as a demotion, per the
 * voice contract: starting earlier is the fast route to the harder material.
