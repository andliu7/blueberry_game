/**
 * An authored problem, and the constructor that refuses a defective one.
 *
 * WHY THE CONSTRUCTOR THROWS. This is the repository's existing pattern:
 * chem-core's `createBond` refuses a bond from an atom to itself, because a
 * malformed structure that reaches a check produces a confusing failure a long
 * way from its cause. Everything `createProblem` refuses below is a defect an
 * author cannot find later by reading, and every one of them throws at the
 * moment the corpus module is imported, which is the earliest possible.
 *
 * The four refusals worth naming, because they are judgement calls rather than
 * type checks:
 *
 *   A DISTRACTOR THAT GRADES CORRECT. A predicted wrong answer that the checker
 *   marks right is either a second correct answer the author did not mean, or a
 *   bug in the checker. Both are worth stopping the build for. This is the single
 *   most useful check in this file: it runs the real checker over the real
 *   authored data every time the corpus loads, so a checker regression shows up
 *   as a corpus that will not import.
 *
 *   TWO DISTRACTORS AT THE SAME POINT. If two predicted wrong answers match each
 *   other, which explanation a student sees depends on authoring order. That is a
 *   coin flip wearing a teaching decision's clothes.
 *
 *   AN UNEXPLAINED OPTION ON A FINITE ANSWER SPACE. Multiple choice has four
 *   wrong answers and an author can write four explanations. Leaving one bare
 *   guarantees a Tier 3 hit that never had to happen, and CLAUDE.md's Budgets
 *   table gates the Tier 3 tail. Same rule for the candidate list on a major
 *   product problem. No other kind can be held to this, because no other kind has
 *   a finite answer space.
 *
 *   COPY THAT BREAKS THE VOICE CONTRACT. See explanation.ts. The lint is narrow
 *   and it is not a substitute for the human read.
