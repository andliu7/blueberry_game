/**
 * @blueberry/curriculum
 *
 * The second engine. Authored problems and answer checking for the two thirds of
 * the syllabus that is not mechanism chemistry.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md, content pipeline: "Most of the curriculum is not mechanism
 * chemistry. Gas laws, thermodynamics, kinetics, titration curves,
 * stoichiometry, and spectroscopy interpretation do not touch chem-core at all.
 * They need an authored problem and answer checking engine, which is a second
 * system alongside the first, not an extension of it. Do not route a limiting
 * reactant problem through a mechanism validator."
 *
 * THE DEPENDENCY DIRECTION. This package may depend on chem-core, for structure
 * questions, and chem-core must never depend on it. One file here imports
 * chem-core, answers/structure.ts, plus one corpus file that authors two
 * molecules. No React, no DOM, no RDKit, no dependencies beyond chem-core.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN HERE, in the order it is worth reading:
 *
 *   kinds.ts           The five answer kinds, and why `mechanism` is not one.
 *   ids.ts             Identifier aliases, and why a ProblemId never changes.
 *   placement.ts       Course and topic taxonomy, the Organic Chemistry II tree
 *                      and its prerequisite edges, the three acts, the cross
 *                      cutting concepts, and the difficulty scale the Elo like
 *                      rating moves against. `docs/COURSE-OUTLINE-ORGO2.md` is
 *                      the authoritative structure and that file is its
 *                      executable half.
 *   pka.ts             The pKa ladder as data, and the Keq and leaving group
 *                      rules the source course runs on it.
 *   stereo.ts          Precomputed CIP and prochiral face labels. Authored, never
 *                      derived on device, per CLAUDE.md's CIP section.
 *   explanation.ts     The three field authored copy shape, and the voice lint.
 *   causes.ts          The named cause registry. Countable by construction.
 *   answers/units.ts   A small unit registry. Case sensitive on purpose.
 *   answers/numeric.ts Value, significant figures, and units. Read the header.
 *   answers/choice.ts  Multiple choice, and major product with its reason.
 *   answers/reagents.ts Reagent sets, and the ordered synthesis read backwards.
 *   answers/structure.ts Constitution comparison, and everything it cannot do.
 *   answer.ts          The spec against state distinction. Read this one early.
 *   problem.ts         The authored problem, and the constructor that refuses.
 *   grading.ts         The result type, the tier order, and the counters.
 *   corpus/            The authored problems, one file per topic block, every
 *                      one carrying real distractors. Weighted to Act 0 and Act 1
 *                      of `docs/COURSE-OUTLINE-ORGO2.md`, which is where the
 *                      pathway opens. `corpusShape()` reports its size.
 *   reactions/         The reaction database. Data with a search function,
 *                      indexed by reagent token, substrate and product class,
 *                      and name. Seeded from the reagent vocabulary in
 *                      `docs/COURSE-OUTLINE-ORGO2.md` section 6.
 *
 * NOT BUILT YET, and each has a seam rather than a stub:
 *
 *   The placement quiz. It walks `TOPICS`, which already carries the
 *   prerequisite edges, and it grades with `gradeAttempt` over problems it
 *   selects by `difficulty`. Nothing about it needs a new answer shape.
 *
 *   Spaced repetition. It is a scheduler over the append only attempt history,
 *   which is Phase 6 data. What this package owes it is `Attempt` and
 *   `GradingResult`, both of which are already serialisable.
