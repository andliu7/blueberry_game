/**
 * The seed corpus, run through the real checkers.
 *
 * Three properties are asserted over every authored problem, and each one is a
 * different way for the corpus and the engine to disagree:
 *
 *   The authored answer grades CORRECT. A checker that cannot accept the answer
 *   its own author wrote is broken, and this is the assertion that catches a
 *   tolerance, a unit, or a significant figure policy that was never tried.
 *
 *   Every distractor grades WRONG, and grades wrong by matching ITSELF. The
 *   first half is enforced at construction time in problem.ts; the second is
 *   asserted here, because a distractor that does not match its own state is a
 *   distractor no student can ever reach.
 *
 *   The copy passes the voice lint. Also enforced at construction, and asserted
 *   here so the number is visible in a test report rather than only in the
 *   absence of an exception.
 *
 * The counts at the bottom are the numbers BUILD-PROMPT.md Phase 3 asks to see
 * reported. They are written as lower bounds rather than exact figures, because
 * an exact count in a test is a line somebody edits down when the corpus shrinks,
 * and a shrinking corpus is the thing worth catching.
