/**
 * ADVERSARY FINDING: the placement quiz's starting frontier can name a topic
 * whose home course is not the recommended course.
 *
 * `prerequisiteClosure` in placement.ts deliberately crosses course boundaries:
 * an Organic Chemistry II topic's prerequisites are commonly Organic Chemistry I
 * topics ("carried prerequisites", per that file's header), and this is by
 * design. `reduceQuiz` in quiz/machine.ts pushes a failed topic's ENTIRE
 * prerequisite closure onto the backward-probing backlog, with no filter that
 * keeps the backlog inside the claimed course.
 *
 * When the walk asks a backlog question from a DIFFERENT course and the student
 * gets it wrong too, `finish()` can select that cross-course topic as part of the
 * frontier. The result is a `Recommendation` whose `course` field names one
 * course while `startTopics` names a topic filed under a different one.
 *
 * This is recorded as a finding rather than a hard failing assertion, because
 * nothing in quiz/machine.ts's comments says whether a cross-course frontier is
 * intended (a legitimate "go fix this Organic Chemistry I gap before continuing
 * in Organic Chemistry II" recommendation) or an oversight. What is not
 * ambiguous is that `Recommendation.course` is a single `CourseId` and Phase 5's
 * pathway is described in CLAUDE.md as a per-course track with unlock gates, so
 * a start topic that is not IN that course's own topic list has no track to
 * unlock into without further handling that does not exist yet in this package.
 * This wants an explicit ruling, recorded the way CLAUDE.md's other rulings are.
