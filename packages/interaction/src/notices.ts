/**
 * Why nothing happened, or why what happened is not what was asked for.
 *
 * A closed union of ids, in the same spirit as chem-core's cause registry and
 * for the same three reasons: a validator can group by it, a report can count
 * it, and an adversary can go looking for the id that has never fired.
 *
 * THESE ARE NOT CHEMISTRY CAUSES AND THEY ARE NOT STUDENT COPY.
 *
 * chem-core's `CauseId` names a chemistry mistake. A `NoticeId` names an
 * interaction outcome: a second finger was ignored, a drag was cancelled, a
 * reagent was already on the list. `detail` on a notice is a log line for a
 * developer and a validator, sized like chem-core's `summary`. The sentence a
 * student reads is authored in packages/feedback, keyed by these ids, and if the
 * two ever disagree that is a bug in one of them.
 *
 * The one place the two meet is `arrow_refused_by_legality`, which carries
 * chem-core's own `ArrowLegalityFinding` list. Those findings already carry a
 * CauseId, so the chemistry reason travels with the interaction refusal instead
 * of being reconstructed from it.
 *
 * The bar shows a yellow warning triangle and nothing else. This file is half of
 * the answer to that; the other half is the cause registry in chem-core.
