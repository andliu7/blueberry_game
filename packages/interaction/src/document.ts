/**
 * The draft, plus the history that lets a student take something back.
 *
 * WHY EVERY CHANGE IS UNDOABLE, INCLUDING SELECTING SOMETHING.
 *
 * The tempting rule is "only commits go on the undo stack". It is wrong here.
 * The hit tester sometimes has to guess between a lone pair and the atom it sits
 * on, and when it guesses wrong the student's correction is "no, the other one",
 * which has to unwind an arming. Making arming undoable costs one array entry
 * and removes a whole class of "why is undo not undoing what I just did".
 *
 * A cancelled drag does NOT use this. It restores a snapshot of the whole
 * document, history included, because a cancelled drag is not an action the
 * student took, and leaving its arming on the undo stack would make the next
 * undo appear to do nothing.
