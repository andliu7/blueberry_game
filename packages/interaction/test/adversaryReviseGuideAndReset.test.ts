/**
 * Adversary pass TWO, Phase 2. Branch phase-2, commit c2efd02.
 *
 * These tests reproduce the two defects the pass-one fix builder disclosed by
 * name but left unfixed (`reviseLastTarget`'s unconditional undo, and
 * `inFlightGuide`'s global rather than per-session read of the selection), plus
 * one adjacent defect found while attacking the same root assumption
 * (`setShape`'s unconditional document reset, which manufactures a false
 * positive for the very staleness guard the pass-one fix introduced), plus one
 * finding in `acceptExternalStructure`.
 *
 * NONE OF THESE ARE INVERTED. Unlike adversarySnapshotIsolation.test.ts, which
 * documents a fixed bug with the fixed assertions, every test below asserts
 * the CURRENT, BROKEN behaviour and is expected to pass against commit
 * c2efd02. When one of these is fixed, invert it in place, the same way pass
 * one's four tests were inverted, and say so in the commit that does it.
