/**
 * Adversary pass THREE, Phase 2. Branch phase-2, commit 5503e00.
 *
 * Scope for this pass: the revise window lifecycle, the owner-doc reference
 * gates on inFlightGuide and R2 release, the setShape no-op guard's own
 * blind spot, the duplicate-id refusal's coverage, and a sweep of anything
 * pass one and pass two never touched (document.ts undo semantics, store.ts,
 * effects.ts, the reagents and ranking reducers, pointer.ts's pressure
 * model).
 *
 * NONE OF THESE ARE FIXED. Every test below that documents a finding asserts
 * the CURRENT, real behaviour and is green today, which is what proves the
 * defect exists rather than merely describing it. That is the same
 * convention pass one and pass two used before their own fixes landed
 * (see adversarySnapshotIsolation.test.ts's header). A future fix pass
 * inverts these in place, the same way it inverted the earlier ones.
 *
 * Tests that instead prove a surface is SOLID assert the correct, safe
 * behaviour and are regression guards against a future change breaking the
 * invariant. Each of those carries the argument for why the surface holds,
 * not just the assertion.

    // saw, so this rarely matters. It is recorded here rather than filed as
    // a defect because nothing about it is incorrect: no data is lost, no

    // told to re-check state it may not need to redraw. It is the one place
    // in this package where the reference-equality discipline that protects
    // every document-level decision is not extended to the highest frequency
    // event type, and that is worth a name for whoever tunes rendering
    // against the 60fps budget.
