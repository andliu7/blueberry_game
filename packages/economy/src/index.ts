/**
 * @blueberry/economy
 *
 * The third engine. XP, Mastery, Diamonds, Charge and Streak, as one pure
 * function of an append only journal and a clock reading handed in from outside.
 *
 * docs/ECONOMY.md is the specification and this package is its executable half.
 * Where a number here disagrees with that document, the document wins.
 *
 * THE ONE DESIGN RULE. Every balance is a DERIVED value, f(journal, now).
 * Nothing is stored as a balance, nowhere, at any layer. That is ECONOMY.md's
 * Anti-abuse section, and it is what makes a server side recomputation able to
 * catch a client that lied: the client can only ever hold a cache of a number
 * the server can recompute from scratch.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN HERE:
 *
 *   journal.ts  The event union and its runtime validator. The only thing
 *               stored. Every event carries `at` and `tz`, so local days are
 *               recomputable and a client clock cannot manufacture one.
 *   rules.ts    Every number in ECONOMY.md as a named frozen constant, with the
 *               table row it came from beside it.
 *   time.ts     Local dates from Intl.DateTimeFormat. No date library.
 *   derive.ts   The derivation, the snapshot shape, and the receipt.
 *
 * NO REACT, NO DOM, NO TIMERS, NO Date.now. `deriveEconomy(journal, now)` takes
 * the clock as an argument, and every test in this package is written against a
 * fixed `now` for that reason. A function in here that read the host clock could
 * not be replayed, and a number that cannot be replayed cannot be audited.
