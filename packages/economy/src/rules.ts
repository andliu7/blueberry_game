 *
 * Two rows are load bearing beyond their size, and both are called out in
 * ECONOMY.md's Supersession section as things that must not be quietly stripped:
 *
 *   CHARGE_COST.review, .tutorial and .intro are 0. "Never gate what repairs
 *   decay", and CLAUDE.md: what sells the product is never gated.
 *
 *   A wrong answer costs 0 of everything. There is deliberately no constant for
 *   it, because a constant is a thing a future edit can set to 1. The absence of
 *   any wrong answer term in derive.ts is the enforcement, and
 *   test/wrong-answers-are-free.test.ts is the proof.

 *
 *   review is the one repeatable earner, so it is paid on EVERY clear rather
