 * The check registry.

 * array entry here. src/cli.ts is not touched, and there is no side effect registration,
 * no decorator, and no directory scan, so the set of checks that will run is readable in
 * one screen and the order is the order written.
 *
 * Do not add a check that cannot fail. An entry here that always returns pass raises the
 * check count in the report while verifying nothing, which is the exact false confidence
 * the suite exists to prevent.
