/**
 * CHECK 9. An E2 declares the torsion it turns on, and a syn periplanar one carries the
 * authored conformational justification CLAUDE.md says it must be flagged for.
 *
 * WHAT CLAUDE.md ASKS FOR, IN ITS OWN WORDS.
 *
 *   "E2 requires periplanarity, dihedral near 0 or 180 degrees. Anti is strongly preferred.
 *   Syn periplanar E2 is real in conformationally locked systems and is flagged as
 *   requiring an authored conformational justification, not rejected."
 *
 * Three separate instructions live in that sentence, and this check is all three.
 * Periplanarity is required. Syn is not rejected. Syn is flagged, and the flag is
 * satisfied by an authored justification rather than by the check deciding for itself
 * whether the cage really is locked.
 *
 * WHY EVERY E2 MUST DECLARE A TORSION, NOT ONLY THE SYN ONES.
 *
 * This is the load bearing decision in the file. If only fixtures that declared a syn
 * torsion had to carry a justification, then the way to author an unjustified syn E2 would
 * be to declare no torsion at all, and the check would never fire on the case it exists
 * for. The requirement to declare is what makes the requirement to justify reachable.
 * It also has a plain chemical reading: an E2 whose dihedral is unstated is a mechanism
 * whose central geometric precondition nobody has claimed is met.
 *
 * WHAT THE CHECK ASSERTS.
 *
 *   1. Every E2 concerted elimination step has exactly one declared torsion, in its `from`
 *      state, whose four atoms are all reaction centres of that step. Exactly one, because
 *      two torsions over the same four centres are two claims about one angle.
 *   1b. AND that a torsion is declared over the four atoms the ARROWS say this elimination
 *      happens at: the hydrogen the base takes, the carbon it came off, the carbon holding
 *      the leaving group, and the leaving group. See below.
 *   2. That torsion is a real dihedral: four distinct atoms, all in one species, bonded in
 *      a chain A-B-C-D. A dihedral is the angle between the A-B-C and B-C-D planes, so four
 *      atoms that are not a bonded chain do not define one, whatever number is written next
 *      to them.
 *   3. Its `justification` is not empty. species.ts requires one because a stated torsion
 *      nobody defended is a number a validator will trust and a student is graded against.
 *   4. Its angle is stated in the convention this schema uses, degrees in [-180, 180].
 *   5. Its angle is periplanar: within the tolerance of 0, syn, or of 180, anti. Anything
 *      else fails with cause `e2_not_periplanar`, which is CLAUDE.md's requirement and the
 *      one hard geometric assertion in this file.
 *   6. If it is syn, the pathway carries exactly one `conformational_justification`
 *      annotation, with a value and a justification. Present, and the fixture passes. This
 *      check never decides whether the stated conformational reason is a good one.
 *
 * WHY RULE 1 ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH, WHICH IS THE PHASE 1 ADVERSARY'S SECOND FINDING.
 *
 * Rule 1 asks whether a torsion's atoms are all in `identity.reactionCenters`. That field
 * is AUTHORED. The adversary filed a real anti periplanar E2 on 2-bromobutane whose
 * reactionCenters were written as the plain carbon backbone [C1, C2, C3, C4] and whose
 * declared torsion was that same backbone at 180 degrees. Every requirement in this file
 * was met by a claim about the ordinary conformation of butane, which says nothing about
 * whether the hydrogen and the bromide are anti to each other. The check could not tell,
 * because both halves of the comparison came from the same authored field.
 *
 * Rule 1b breaks that circle by deriving the four atoms from the arrows instead. In a
 * correctly drawn E2 all four are named by arrows: the base to hydrogen arrow names the
 * hydrogen, the pi forming arrow names both carbons, and the leaving group arrow names the
 * leaving group and the carbon it sits on. `deriveE2Quartet` in arrow-facts.ts does that
 * and returns undefined when the drawing is not one it can read, in which case rule 1b
 * stands down rather than guessing. `conservation-step-identity` attacks the same circle
 * from the other side by asking that every declared reaction centre be an atom some arrow
 * touches, which is what the backbone fixture violates first.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT.
 *
 * That anti is better than syn. Nothing here prefers, penalises, or ranks the two: a syn
 * periplanar E2 with the annotation passes exactly as cleanly as an anti one, which is what
 * "flagged, not rejected" means. `docs/VERIFICATION.md` S3 is the same instruction. It also
 * does not read the conformational justification for sense. Whether a bicyclo[2.2.1] cage
 * genuinely cannot reach 180 degrees is chemistry a human wrote down and a human reviews.
 *
 * THE TOLERANCE, AND WHY IT IS ONE NUMBER RATHER THAN TWO.
 *
 * 30 degrees either side. The two windows it creates, [-30, 30] and [150, 180] with its
 * mirror, are disjoint, so no angle is ever both syn and anti and no angle falls between
 * them without being reported. A tolerance is needed at all because real locked systems do
 * not sit at exactly 0: norbornane's exo-exo H-C-C-Br torsion is a few degrees off, and a
 * check demanding 0.0 would fail on correct chemistry, which is the S1 mistake wearing a
 * different hat. Loosening this number to make a fixture pass is a weakening, and the
 * fixture that would need it is a fixture whose geometry is not periplanar.
