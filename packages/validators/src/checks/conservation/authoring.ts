/**
 * Shared machinery for the three schema v2 annotation checks. No chemistry decisions here.
 *
 * WHAT AN ANNOTATION CHECK IS ALLOWED TO ASSERT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
 *
 * It asserts that a human wrote something down. It never asserts what they wrote. CLAUDE.md
 * draws that line twice and `docs/VERIFICATION.md` S1 draws it a third time: the SN1
 * racemisation ratio "is an authoring annotation, never a computed assertion", and a
 * validator asserting 50:50 "fails on correct chemistry, and an app built on it tells
 * students something an instructor will mark wrong". So these checks read `kind`, they read
 * whether `value` and `justification` are empty, and they count how many annotations of a
 * kind there are. They do not parse a ratio, compare a number, or grade prose.
 *
 * The exceptions are narrow, and each is stated where it happens. `rate-comparison.ts`
 * scans a justification for the name of a `MechanismRoute`, because "names the competing
 * pathway" is a requirement about naming and the set of route names is closed and finite.
 * `annotationGroundingViolations` below asks that a claim about a site names the site, by
 * atom id or species id. Neither grades the claim. Both check that a name from a known,
 * finite list is present, which is a requirement about reference rather than about
 * content, and the difference is the whole reason they are allowed here.
 *
 * The Phase 1 adversary showed why presence alone was not enough: an annotation of "z"
 * and "z" satisfied every rule in this file while saying nothing. The answer is not a
 * character count, which two words defeat. See the long note on
 * `annotationGroundingViolations`.
 *
 * WHY MORE THAN ONE ANNOTATION OF A REQUIRED KIND IS A FAILURE, AND WHY THAT SENTENCE
 * USED TO BE WRONG.
 *
 * Two racemisation ratios ABOUT THE SAME CENTRE are two authored claims about one thing,
 * and nothing downstream can pick between them. A reader takes the first, a renderer takes
 * the last, and neither is wrong about what the file says. One authored claim per place
 * that requires one keeps the annotation a statement rather than a menu.
 *
 * That was previously enforced by counting annotations PER PATHWAY, which is a different
 * and false rule: a pathway with two independent SN1 captures, each carrying its own
 * correctly grounded ratio, was rejected as though the two claims were about one cation.
 * `good-sn1-two-independent-captures-in-one-pathway-each-correctly-annotated` is that
 * fixture and it is correct chemistry, correctly annotated. CLAUDE.md treats a check that
 * rejects correct work exactly as seriously as one that accepts wrong work, so the scope
 * is now the OCCURRENCE rather than the pathway. See `AnnotationOccurrence`.
 *
 * The same defect existed one check over in `periplanarity.ts`, which asked for a
 * `conformational_justification` once per syn periplanar E2 STEP while counting
 * annotations across the whole pathway. Both directions were wrong there: two justified
 * syn eliminations were rejected, and two syn eliminations sharing ONE justification were
 * accepted. Both call sites now pass their occurrence list here and both directions are
 * decided in this file, once.
 *
 * Kinds that no check requires, `condition_note` most of all, are not held to any of this
 * and may repeat freely.
 *
 * HOW AN ANNOTATION BINDS TO THE OCCURRENCE IT IS ABOUT.
 *
 * `AuthoredAnnotation` in chem-core is `{ kind, value, justification }`. It carries no
 * pointer to a step, so there is no structural field to read. The binding used here is the
 * one already available in the data: the annotation NAMES the step it is about, by step
 * id, in its value or its justification, exactly as the grounding rule below already
 * requires it to name an atom or a species. A name from a known finite list, present or
 * absent. Nothing about what the sentence says.
 *
 * When a pathway has exactly ONE occurrence of the requirement, the binding is implicit
 * and no step id is needed: there is only one thing the claim could be about. That keeps
 * every honestly authored single occurrence fixture in the corpus unchanged, and it is why
 * this rule adds no new burden to the common case. Two or more occurrences, and each
 * annotation has to say which one it is for.
 *
 * WHAT AN ANNOTATION NAMING TWO OCCURRENCES MEANS. IT MEANS THE FILE DOES NOT SAY.
 *
 * This is the third pass adversary's finding, and it is the third appearance of one defect.
 * The scope was wrong at pathway level, then wrong at occurrence level, and this is the
 * structural answer rather than a third patch at a third scope.
 *
 * The rule that used to be here filtered the occurrences an annotation names and then
 * pushed THE SAME annotation object onto each of their claim lists. One annotation naming
 * two step ids therefore satisfied "exactly one claim here" at both of them, and
 * `good-known-limit-one-racemisation-ratio-annotation-naming-both-sn1-captures-satisfies-both-occurrences`
 * is that file: one authored sentence covering an SN1 capture at a carbon that is not
 * stereogenic and an SN1 capture at a carbon with net inversion excess. Two chemically
 * distinct centres with two different correct answers, and one claim on file said to be
 * both of them.
 *
 * So the meaning enforced from here on is stated positively, and it is the only meaning
 * that survives the two answers being different:
 *
 *   ONE ANNOTATION IS ONE CLAIM, AND ONE CLAIM IS ABOUT EXACTLY ONE OCCURRENCE.
 *
 * An annotation that names two occurrences is not two claims. It is one claim that does not
 * say which place it is the claim for, which is the same failure as an annotation that
 * names none of them, arrived at from the other side. So it satisfies NEITHER occurrence,
 * and each occurrence it names reports that the only thing naming it is shared. The remedy
 * is in the failure line and it is the boring one: write one annotation per occurrence.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately NOT done. The annotation is not consumed by the first
 * occurrence it names, nor by the last, nor by the nearest. Those are the position
 * heuristics the pass before this one rejected, and they are rejected here for the same
 * reason: they silently pick a subject rather than reporting that the file does not name
 * one. Nothing about that reasoning is undone. What changes is only that "names two" now
 * resolves to zero satisfied occurrences instead of two.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BINDING COSTS, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.
 *
 * An annotation whose prose names a SIBLING occurrence's step id, for contrast rather than
 * as its subject, binds to both and satisfies neither. When the sibling carries its own
 * annotation as well, the sibling reports two claims about it; when the sibling carries
 * nothing else, the sibling reports that the only thing naming it is shared. Either way the
 * remedy is the same and is in the failure line: name only the step this claim is about and
 * refer to the others by description. That is a real cost, and it is paid deliberately,
 * because the alternative readings, first id wins or last id wins, are position heuristics
 * that would silently pick a subject rather than reporting that the file does not say which.
 *
 * THE STRUCTURAL ALTERNATIVE, WHICH IS NOT TAKEN HERE AND SHOULD BE LATER.
 *
 * The boring fix is a field: `AuthoredAnnotation.appliesTo?: StepId` in chem-core, a
 * fixture schema version bump to v3 to carry it, and a rule here that prefers the field
 * and falls back to the naming convention for annotations that omit it. That is a
 * chem-core change and this task does not own chem-core, so it is reported rather than
 * made. Until it exists, the binding is the naming convention above, and the convention
 * is enforced rather than assumed: an annotation that names no occurrence fails.
