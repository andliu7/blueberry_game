/**
 * CHECK 11. What the step SAYS it is, against what its arrows SHOW it is.
 *
 * THE HOLE THIS CLOSES, IN THE PHASE 1 ADVERSARY'S WORDS.
 *
 *   "Nothing anywhere cross validates identity.elementaryStep against what the arrows and
 *   states actually describe. It is enum checked, then used to gate the annotation checks
 *   by exact string match. A pi bond attack mislabelled bond_homolysis, or an E2
 *   mislabelled proton_transfer, passes identically."
 *
 * step.ts predicted the shape of this check before the gap was found. It says
 * `reactionCenters` is "named explicitly rather than derived from the arrows, so that a
 * step whose arrows are wrong can still be talked about", and then: "the disagreement
 * between these and the arrow endpoints is itself informative". Nothing was reading that
 * disagreement. This file reads it.
 *
 * THE DESIGN, AND THE ONE DECISION EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS FROM.
 *
 * This check does NOT classify a step. It does not compute "this is really a hydride
 * shift" and compare that against the label, because for most of the eighteen
 * `ElementaryStepKind` members the arrows genuinely do not determine which one applies,
 * and a classifier forced to pick would be wrong on correct chemistry. Instead it holds a
 * short list of NECESSARY CONDITIONS, each one a property the arrows must have if the
 * declared kind is true, each one separately defensible, and each one with its own
 * negative control on disk. A kind no condition mentions is a kind this check says nothing
 * about, and that is a documented blind spot rather than a silent pass.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN DISCRIMINATE.
 *
 *   1. A hydride from a proton. THE case the adversary named. The difference is whether
 *      the hydrogen's own bonding pair moved with it, and the arrows declare exactly that:
 *      the bond forming arrow pivots on the hydrogen (carried, a hydride) or on the
 *      acceptor (donated, a proton). See `hydrogenMigrations`.
 *   2. Radical from polar. A fishhook is one electron and a curved arrow is two, and the
 *      count is on the arrow. A step declared `proton_transfer` cannot be drawn with
 *      fishhooks and a step declared `bond_homolysis` cannot be drawn without them.
 *   3. A proton transfer from an elimination or a substitution. A plain proton transfer
 *      moves a proton. If a heavy atom sigma bond also breaks completely in the same step
 *      and its pair localises as a lone pair, something left, and the step is at least an
 *      elimination. This is what catches an E2 mislabelled `proton_transfer`.
 *   4. Whether the declared reaction centres are the atoms the arrows actually touch. Not
 *      a step kind, the other half of the same field, and the thing that lets a
 *      periplarity declaration be about an unrelated part of the molecule.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DISCRIMINATE, STATED SO A GREEN RUN IS NOT READ AS MORE.
 *
 *   `nucleophilic_attack` from `coordination` from `ring_closure`. All three are a lone
 *   pair forming a new sigma bond. Which one it is depends on whether the two atoms were
 *   already in one molecule and on what the resulting bond is called, and the third of
 *   those is nomenclature rather than electron flow.
 *
 *   `bond_heterolysis` from `leaving_group_departure`. Identical arrows,
 *   bond(A-B) -> atom(B). The corpus uses the first when the fragment is the point and the
 *   second when the substrate is, and no arrow says which.
 *
 *   `hydride_shift` from an intermolecular hydride delivery. Both are a hydrogen carrying
 *   its pair. `good-hydride-transfer-from-borohydride-to-acetone` declares
 *   `nucleophilic_attack` for exactly that reason and is correct to. Only the reverse
 *   direction is asserted here: a carried hydride is never a `proton_transfer`.
 *
 *   `concerted_substitution` from a two step sequence drawn as one, `pi_bond_attack` from
 *   any other use of a pi bond as a nucleophile, `tautomerisation` from the proton
 *   transfer it is made of, `alkyl_shift` from `ring_contraction` chemistry the corpus
 *   does not yet contain, and every pericyclic kind. None of these are attempted.
 *
 * WHEN THIS CHECK STANDS DOWN ENTIRELY.
 *
 * A step with no arrows says nothing about electron flow, so nothing here can contradict
 * its label. `conservation-electron-flow` is the check that fires on a structural change
 * with no arrows behind it, and it does. A step whose arrow references do not resolve is
 * `conservation-arrow-legality`'s finding; a set of touched atoms assembled from arrows
 * pointing at nothing is smaller than the truth, and asserting against it would report a
 * grounding failure that is really a dangling reference.
 *
 * THE CAUSE ID, WHICH IS A KNOWN IMPRECISION AND IS REPORTED AS ONE.
 *
 * chem-core's registry has no cause for "the declared step kind contradicts the electron
 * flow". The nearest member is `step_not_elementary`, whose category is `route` and which
 * is about step identity, and it is what these violations carry. Its student facing copy
 * says "several separate steps are drawn as one", which is the right family of complaint
 * and the wrong sentence for a mislabelled step. chem-core is outside this package's
 * ownership, so the id is not invented here. A cause along the lines of
 * `step_kind_disagrees_with_electron_flow` belongs in causes.ts, and when it exists the
 * constant below is the only line that changes. The fishhook rule is the exception: a
 * radical arrow in a polar step already has an exact cause and uses it.
 */

/**
 * The nearest registered cause for a declared kind that the arrows contradict.
 *
 * Not the right cause. See the paragraph above. Every violation in this file except the
 * fishhook one carries it, so repointing is one edit.
