/**
 * The shared body every check in this family runs, and the rule that makes the corpus
 * two sided.
 *
 * A check author writes a `ViolationFinder`: given one fixture, return every place the
 * chemistry is wrong. Nothing else. This file decides what a violation MEANS, using the
 * fixture's own `expect` declaration:
 *
 *   good fixture                        every violation is a failure.
 *   broken, this check in mustFail      NO violation is a failure. The negative control
 *                                       did not fire, so the check is not proven to work.
 *   broken, this check not in mustFail  every violation is a failure. A broken fixture
 *                                       has to break exactly the checks it declares, or
 *                                       the declaration is not describing the fixture.
 *
 * That third rule is the one worth defending. Without it a single fixture that fails
 * everything would satisfy every negative control at once, and the family would be proven
 * to fire without any check being proven to fire ON THE RIGHT THING. With it, cascades
 * have to be written down, and a cascade that is written down is a cascade an adversary
 * can argue with.
 *
 * Two more rules, both of which turn deletion into a red run:
 *
 *   - A check with no negative control anywhere in the corpus FAILS. Deleting the fixture
 *     that proves a check works does not quietly turn that check into decoration.
 *   - An empty corpus FAILS. Every check in this family is a statement about fixtures,
 *     and a statement about nothing is not evidence.
 *
 * A finder that throws is recorded as a failure against the fixture it threw on, never as
 * a skip and never as a fired negative control. A check that crashes has not decided
 * anything, and a broken fixture is required to fail cleanly rather than by explosion.

 *
 * `run` deliberately swallows violations on a fixture that declared this check in
 * `mustFail`: a negative control that fires is the check working, not a failure. That is
 * correct for reporting a verdict and useless for measuring, because the fixtures whose
 * causes the feedback axis needs to count are exactly the ones whose violations `run`
 * consumes. So `checks/feedback/named-causes.ts` calls the finder directly and reads the
 * `cause` off each violation.
 *
 * This is additive. `run` is unchanged, the registry is unchanged, and nothing in this
 * file behaves differently. The alternative was for the feedback check to recompute the
 * chemistry itself, which would make the number it reports a statement about a second
 * implementation rather than about the one the suite runs.
