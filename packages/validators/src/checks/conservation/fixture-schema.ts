/**
 * The on disk fixture format, and the only thing that turns bytes into chem-core objects.
 *
 * WHY JSON AND NOT TYPESCRIPT.
 *
 * A fixture is evidence. Evidence that is also code can compute its own answer, import a
 * helper that happens to be the thing under test, or quietly call a chem-core constructor
 * that normalises the very field the fixture was written to break. JSON cannot do any of
 * that. It is inert, it diffs line by line in a review, it is hashed by
 * validators.lock.json as data, and an adversary can author one without touching a build.
 *
 * WHY THE PARSER IS STRICT ABOUT UNKNOWN KEYS.
 *
 * A fixture that carries "justifcation" instead of "justification" would otherwise read as
 * a spectator with no justification, which is a real finding produced by a typo rather
 * than by chemistry. Worse, a typo in "mustFail" would silently downgrade a negative
 * control to an ordinary fixture, and the check it was meant to prove would go unproven.
 * Unknown keys are rejected everywhere.
 *
 * WHY EMPTY STRINGS ARE NOT REJECTED HERE.
 *
 * `justification: ""` on a spectator declaration is exactly what
 * `conservation-spectator-declaration` exists to catch. If the parser rejected it, the
 * negative control could not be written, and the check could never be shown to fire.
 * The parser enforces shape. The checks enforce chemistry and policy.
 *
 * WHAT V2 ADDED, AND WHY THE VERSION WENT UP.
 *
 * V1 carried no declared torsions and no authored annotations, on the stated ground that
 * a field no check reads is a field that can be wrong forever without anyone noticing.
 * That was right at the time and it stopped being right the moment CLAUDE.md's three
 * graded chemistry requirements had nowhere to live but prose. `MechanismPathway` in
 * chem-core already carried `annotations`, and `Species` already carried
 * `DeclaredTorsion`, so the corpus could not say what the engine could already model:
 *
 *   the SN1 racemisation ratio, which is an authoring annotation and never a computed
 *   assertion, so it has to be readable as data before any check can require it,
 *   the conformational justification a syn periplanar E2 is flagged as requiring,
 *   the rate comparison that names the competing pathway on a strongly disfavoured but
 *   permitted step.
 *
 * V2 adds `pathway.annotations` and `species.declaredTorsions`, shaped exactly like the
 * chem-core types they are parsed into. No parallel shape, no second vocabulary: the
 * annotation kinds are `AuthoredAnnotation["kind"]` and a torsion is a `DeclaredTorsion`.
 * Three checks read them, and each has a negative control, so the rule above still holds.
 *
 * BREAKING, DELIBERATELY. A fixture still declaring `schemaVersion: 1` is refused by
 * parseFixture with a load error, which every check in the family reports as a failure.
 * There is no silent upgrade path and there should not be one: a v1 file loaded as v2
 * would be a syn periplanar E2 with no torsion and no annotation, which is precisely what
 * the new checks exist to catch, and it would be read as an authoring gap rather than as a
 * stale file.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCHEMA STILL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CARRY.
 *
 * Stereo configuration itself. No R/S, no E/Z, no wedge and hash, no coordinates. A
 * declared torsion is one authored number about one four atom chain, which is what E2
 * periplanarity turns on and nothing more. CIP descriptors are RDKit's job in the oracle
 * corpus (`.oracle.json`), per CLAUDE.md: chem-core computes geometry and never assigns
 * descriptors. When a stereochemistry family is written it extends this schema again, and
 * the version number goes up again.

/**
 * The names of the eleven checks in this family.
 *
 * A fixture's `expect.mustFail` names checks from this list. Naming anything else is a
 * failure rather than a no-op, so a renamed check cannot silently orphan its own negative
 * control.
 *
 * `conservation-arrow-legality` is the seventh and was added after the Phase 0 adversary
 * showed that nothing in the package asked whether a single arrow was drawable, only
 * whether all of them summed to the right total. The fixture that proved it,
 * good-adversarial-sn2-with-swapped-arrows-producing-identical-declared-deltas, recorded
 * in its own note that it could not be declared broken because "there is no check name in
 * CONSERVATION_CHECK_NAMES this package could declare as the one that is supposed to catch
 * it". This line is that name.
 *
 * The last three arrived with schema v2 and are the same story a second time. The Phase 1
 * corpus builder recorded three CLAUDE.md requirements it could not express as data and
 * had to leave as prose in `expect.note`, where no check could read them. These are their
 * names. They are annotation checks rather than arithmetic checks, and they sit in this
 * family because they run over the same corpus, use the same two sided good and broken
 * declaration, and would otherwise need a second copy of family.ts to say the same things.
 *
 * `conservation-step-identity` is the eleventh and is the same story a third time. The
 * Phase 1 adversary filed a fixture whose note recorded that nothing in the package cross
 * validates `identity.elementaryStep` against the electron flow, and it had to be filed
 * good because no name here could be declared as the check that ought to catch it. This
 * line is that name, and that fixture is now broken.
 *
 * `conservation-step-elementarity` is the twelfth and is the same story a fourth time. The
 * second pass adversary filed an SN2 and an unrelated deprotonation four carbons away drawn
 * as one step, and had to file it good because no name here could be declared as the check
 * that ought to catch it, even though chem-core has carried `step_not_elementary` since
 * Phase 1 with nothing able to emit it. This line is that name.
 *
 * `conservation-fixture-schema` is the thirteenth and is the odd one out, because it is the
 * only name here that is not a violation finder. It is the LOADER: the assertion that every
 * file in fixtures/ turns into a pathway at all. That assertion has always run, inside every
 * other check, and it has never had a name, so a fixture that ought to be refused had no way
 * to say so and a refusal was unconditionally a failure. The fourth pass adversary filed a
 * pathway with two steps carrying the same id, and the honest place to catch that is the
 * loader rather than a chemistry check; see the long note in `parsePathway`. This line is
 * the name that lets such a fixture be a negative control instead of a red run.

  /*
   * STEP IDS ARE UNIQUE WITHIN A PATHWAY. THE FOURTH PASS ADVERSARY'S FINDING.
   *
   * WHAT DEPENDS ON THIS, WHICH IS MORE THAN THE ONE CHECK THAT NOTICED.
   *
   * `authoring.ts` binds an authored annotation to the step it is a claim about by NAME:
   * chem-core's `AuthoredAnnotation` carries no step pointer, so the step id written in the
   * annotation's prose is the whole binding. Every map and every filter in
   * `requiredAnnotationViolations` is keyed by that string. Two steps sharing one id make
   * the binding undecidable in a way that has no correct answer: an annotation naming the
   * shared id names both occurrences, so it is exclusive to neither, and two honestly
   * written annotations, each about exactly one cation, both fail. That is a check
   * rejecting correct chemistry, which CLAUDE.md treats exactly as seriously as a check
   * accepting wrong chemistry.
   *
   * The annotation binding is the loudest consumer and it is not the only one. EVERY check
   * in this family renders `step.id` into the `where` of a violation. With two steps called
   * `step-1`, every failure line in the family names a step the reader cannot identify. So
   * this is not one check's precondition. It is a property of the file, and the file is
   * what this module owns.
   *
   * WHY THIS IS ENFORCED IN THE PARSER AND NOT AS A VIOLATION IN A CHECK.
   *
   * The precedent one level down went the other way, and the difference is worth stating
   * rather than glossing. Species id uniqueness within a state is enforced by
   * `conservation-valence` as a structural precondition, because a duplicated species id
   * corrupts the ARITHMETIC that check performs and because chem-core defines a real
   * `CauseId` for it, `duplicate_species_id_in_state`, so the finding can be handed to a
   * student in the vocabulary every other finding uses.
   *
   * A duplicated step id has neither property. It corrupts no arithmetic, and there is no
   * CauseId for it, because it is not something a student can do: a student never writes a
   * step id. `Violation` requires a `cause`, and the only honest values available all name
   * something else. Borrowing `duplicate_species_id_in_state` would put a sentence about
   * species in front of a reader looking at steps, which is the generic-failure behaviour
   * this repository's feedback axis exists to beat. A load refusal carries no cause, and
   * that is correct here: this is a defect in the FILE, not in the chemistry the file
   * describes.
   *
   * Refusing also makes the message arrive first and once. The alternative, a violation in
   * each of the twelve checks that render a step id, would report one mistake twelve times;
   * a violation in only the annotation checks would leave the class open for every pathway
   * that happens to carry no annotations.
   *
   * WHAT THIS COSTS. A fixture refused here is checked for nothing else: no mass, no
   * charge, no valence. That is deliberate, and it is the same judgement the refusal is
   * built on. Nothing downstream can name which of two identical steps a finding is about,
   * so a report about this file would be a report a human cannot act on.
   *
   * HOW A FIXTURE DECLARES THAT IT MUST BE REFUSED. `expect.mustFail` may name
   * `conservation-fixture-schema`, exactly as it names any other check. See the note on
   * `LOADER_CHECK_NAME` in family.ts for how a refusal is then read as a fired negative
   * control rather than as a failure.
