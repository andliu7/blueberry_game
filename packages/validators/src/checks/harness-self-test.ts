/**
 * The one check shipped with the skeleton.
 *
 * It is not a chemistry check and it is not a placeholder. It checks the aggregation
 * logic in src/registry.ts, which is the code that decides whether this process exits
 * zero. If that code ever swallows a failure, every chemistry check written later
 * reports green while proving nothing, and nothing else in the suite would notice.
 *
 * A check that always passes would be worse than no check, so this one asserts against
 * real behaviour and fails if the behaviour changes. Flip any assertion below and
 * `npm run validate` exits nonzero. That is the intended way to test the failure path.
