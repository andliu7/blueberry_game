/**
 * Suite integrity.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md, "Suite integrity": packages/validators carries a committed
 * validators.lock.json holding a hash of every file in the package. Every validator run
 * recomputes and compares first. On mismatch the validator reports MODIFIED with the
 * changed file list and refuses to report results.
 *
 * docs/VERIFICATION.md S7 records why this exists: the draft asked the validator to
 * confirm the suite was unmodified and gave it no way to know, so it would either skip
 * the step or invent a confirmation.
 *
 * Regenerating the lock is a deliberate, separate act. Nothing in this file writes the
 * lock except regenerateLock(), and nothing calls regenerateLock() except the explicit
 * `lock regen` subcommand.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE EXTERNAL DATA SET, WHICH IS THE SECOND HALF OF THIS FILE.
 *
 * Hashing every file in packages/validators states one thing: the suite is the suite
 * that was reviewed. It does not state that the suite's ANSWERS are the answers that
 * were reviewed, and the two came apart in adversary pass two, finding 4.
 *
 * `conservation-disfavoured-rate-comparison` rule 4 decides whether a fixture's named
 * competing pathway is believed by asking `competingRoutesFor()` in
 * @blueberry/feedback, whose data is one array literal in
 * packages/feedback/src/copy/sterics.ts. Nothing under packages/validators changes when
 * that array changes. So a fixture the suite rejects today can be made to pass by
 * editing an ordinary implementation package, with no fixture edit, no lock mismatch,
 * and nothing at all to see in a validator run. The intent of the lock, that a suite
 * edited by the agent under test is not evidence, leaks the moment a validator
 * assertion depends on data outside the hashed set.
 *
 * WHAT IS FINGERPRINTED, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE WHOLE PACKAGE.
 *
 * Hashing all of packages/feedback would work and would be wrong in practice. That
 * package is authored student copy. The prose in it is meant to be rewritten, often,
 * by somebody who is not touching chemistry, and a lock that reports MODIFIED on every
 * wording edit gets regenerated without being read, which is how a lock stops being a
 * lock. So the fingerprint is narrower than the file and narrower than the package:
 *
 *   1. The DATA the validator grades against, extracted from the source text. For
 *      @blueberry/feedback that is the `competingRoutes` arrays in
 *      packages/feedback/src/copy/, and nothing else in those files. Rewriting
 *      whatYouDid, why, or lookAt changes no fingerprint. Changing which route beats a
 *      hindered SN2 changes it, and the lock diff shows the old and new route lists in
 *      plain text rather than a hash, because the point is that a human reviewing the
 *      diff can see what moved.
 *   2. The CODE that turns that data into the answer the validator reads, byte for
 *      byte: registry.ts and index.ts. Those are plumbing, not prose, and they are what
 *      you would have to edit to make `competingRoutesFor` return something the copy
 *      files do not say.
 *   3. The LIST of files the data was extracted from. A new file in copy/ changes the
 *      recorded list, so the extracted set cannot grow or shrink in silence.
 *
 * WHY THE DECLARATION IS A CENSUS AND NOT A LIST OF FAVOURITES.
 *
 * A declaration nobody is forced to update is a comment. So EXTERNAL_DATA below is
 * checked for completeness against the actual import graph of this package on every
 * run: every module specifier this package imports for its VALUES has to appear, and
 * for a package that plays more than one role, every imported binding has to be
 * classified. An import nobody declared is a hard stop with its own status, not a
 * warning, and `lock regen` refuses to write a lock while one exists, so regeneration
 * cannot bless an undeclared dependency by accident. A declared entry that nothing
 * imports any more is also a stop, because a census that only grows stops describing
 * anything.
 *
 * This mirrors CLAUDE.md's system boundary rule for spectators: a thing may be excluded
 * from the accounting, but declaring it is an explicit, recorded act that a validator
 * can see and an adversary can attack.
 *
 * WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN AT packages/chem-core, WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE
 * QUESTION.
 *
 * chem-core is declared, and it is deliberately not fingerprinted. The suite exists to
 * grade chem-core. A gate that reported the suite as MODIFIED on every engine edit
 * would be telling a builder that improving the thing under test has invalidated the
 * evidence, which is backwards: the correct reaction to an engine edit is to RE-RUN the
 * checks, not to refuse to run them. chem-core is also not unguarded. It already has a
 * gate built for exactly this shape, `chemCoreSourceFingerprint()` in
 * measure/mutation-record.ts, which hashes src, test, and both config files and reports
 * the mutation score STALE the moment any byte moves. STALE forces a fresh measurement.
 * MODIFIED refuses to report. Those are the right verbs for the two cases, and this
 * file borrows that file's vocabulary rather than inventing a second one: a fingerprint
 * over a declared set of paths, CRLF normalised, with the path in the hash alongside the
 * content so a rename is a change.
 *
 * The residual risk, stated rather than hidden: a check that grades a fixture against
 * chem-core data, `allMechanismRoutes()` for instance, is trusting the subject under
 * test as a vocabulary. That is a narrower exposure than the feedback one was, because
 * MechanismRoute is a closed union in the type system, so editing it breaks compilation
 * across every fixture and check that names a route, and because any such edit makes
 * the mutation record STALE. It is not zero. If a later phase adds a check that reads
 * chem-core as an answer key rather than as a vocabulary, the honest fix is to add a
 * projection for that specific datum, exactly as was done here for competingRoutes, not
 * to fingerprint the whole engine.

 * Calls that pull in a module whose specifier is not a string literal.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A WIDER REGEX, WHICH IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE FOURTH PASS
 * ADVERSARY'S FINDING.
 *
 * `import(someVariable)` and `require(someVariable)` cannot be read by any amount of
 * pattern matching, because the specifier is not in the text: it is whatever the variable
 * holds at run time, and the honest general answer needs an evaluator. The previous
 * behaviour was to match nothing and move on, which reads in a green run exactly like
 * "there is no import here".
 *
 * The precedent for the other choice is already in this file. `extractCompetingRoutes`
 * refuses a `competingRoutes` property it cannot parse instead of skipping it, and says
 * why: "the difference between 'there is no competing route data here' and 'I could not
 * read the competing route data here' is the difference between a gate and a decoration."
 * The same sentence applies here word for word. So an unreadable specifier is a hard
 * finding, and the remedy is in the finding: write the specifier as a literal.
 *
 * `createRequire` IS INCLUDED, AND IT IS THE ONE JUDGEMENT CALL HERE.
 *
 * The adversary's third specimen obtains a require through
 * `const req = createRequire(import.meta.url)` and then calls `req("pkg")`. No regex can
 * follow that, because the function is bound to an arbitrary local name. What CAN be seen
 * is the manufacture: `createRequire` is the only standard way to conjure a working
 * `require` inside an ES module, and this package has no legitimate use for one. So its
 * appearance is reported. That is deliberately a rule about a name rather than about a
 * shape, and it is stated here rather than hidden: it can be defeated by aliasing the
 * import, and closing that needs a real parser rather than a bigger regex.
 *
 * Read from source with STRINGS BLANKED as well as comments, unlike `scanImports`. A
 * specimen of this shape written inside a template literal, which is exactly how the
 * adversary's own test files are written so they do not count as real imports of
 * themselves, must not be reported as a real one.

/**
 * Parse an import clause into the exported names it pulls in for their values.
 *
 * THE WILDCARD CASES, WHICH IS WHERE THE THIRD PASS ADVERSARY FOUND A HOLE.
 *
 * Three shapes carry a wildcard, and all three make every named export of the other module
 * reachable from this one as a value:
 *
 *     import * as ns from "pkg"     a namespace object bound locally
 *     export * as ns from "pkg"     the same object, re-exported
 *     export * from "pkg"           every named export re-exported one at a time
 *
 * The first two were recorded as the binding "*". The third was recorded as NOTHING,
 * because the only wildcard branch here required the literal keyword `as`, so the lone "*"
 * fell through to the plain identifier test and matched neither. The caller then skipped
 * the site entirely on `valueBindings.length === 0`, so a wholly undeclared external
 * package introduced by one bare `export *` produced no census finding at all: not
 * undeclared-package, not undeclared-binding, nothing.
 *
 * The fix is here rather than in `censusFindings`, and the reason is that this was a
 * SCANNER defect and not a census defect. `censusFindings` was asked the wrong question:
 * it was told the barrel imported no values, and it answered correctly for what it was
 * told. The adversary's own suggestion, walking `seenPackages` as well as `byPackage`,
 * would have made the census right about this one case by making it wrong about two
 * others. `seenPackages` deliberately holds every specifier seen AT ALL, type only and
 * side effect imports included, and the census's stated contract is about VALUES: a type
 * is erased at runtime and cannot carry data the suite grades against, which is why a type
 * only import contributes no bindings on purpose. Reporting `undeclared-package` off
 * `seenPackages` would turn `import type { Foo } from "pkg"` into a hard stop, and the
 * finding's own wording, "is imported for its values (...)", would be false with an empty
 * binding list inside the parentheses. `seenPackages` also already has a second job, as
 * the fallback that keeps a declared but type only package from reading as
 * declared-but-unused, and one set cannot mean "seen" in one rule and "imported for its
 * values" in another.
 *
 * So a bare `export *` is recorded as the wildcard binding "*", exactly as `import * as`
 * already was. The two forms then behave identically everywhere downstream, including the
 * per binding classification a `mixed` package requires, and nothing else in this file
 * changes. `export type * from "pkg"` stays type only and stays empty, because the clause
 * begins with `type` and is refused at the top of this function.
