/**
 * The 44 by 44 hit target budget, measured rather than asserted.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. CLAUDE.md's Budgets table carries "Minimum hit target 44 by 44
 * points" and until now no gate read it. The sticker audit scores colour and
 * shape and never area; `hudGeometryHolds` in economy-moments.mjs walks the
 * three header readouts and nothing else. So a pressable control anywhere else
 * in the app could sit under the floor for a whole phase and every gate would
 * stay green. One did: the pathway's side quest chip has measured 154 by 34
 * since the S2 round.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, and the distinction is load bearing. `offsetWidth` and
 * `offsetHeight`, which are the LAYOUT box, never `getBoundingClientRect()`,
 * which is the TRANSFORMED one. Every control in this app carries `.press`,
 * and `.press:active` is `transform: scale(0.96)`, so a rect read during the
 * 120 ms settle of a press measures a 44px button at 43.5. The S4 round found
 * that the hard way in the sticker audit and fixed it there; this script is
 * written the right way from its first run.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A CONTROL. Anything a pointer can press: `button`, `a[href]`,
 * `[role="button"]`, `[role="tab"]`, `[role="switch"]`, and form inputs. Hidden
 * elements (zero box, `visibility: hidden`, `display: none`, an inert subtree)
 * are skipped, because an off screen control is not a target. A control whose
 * own box is under the floor but which is WRAPPED in a large enough pressable
 * ancestor is still reported, because the ancestor is not what receives the
 * press.
 *
 * IT IS A FLOOR CHECK AND IT DOES NOT SCORE SPACING. Two 44px targets 2px apart
 * are a mis-tap problem this script cannot see; that is the synthetic fingertip
 * model in the win axes table and it belongs to the trainer's own measurement.
