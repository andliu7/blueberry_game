/**
 * THE CONTRAST GATE, NARROWED TO ONE ROUTE. Not a weakened gate: a copy of
 * contrast-audit.mjs with a route filter and nothing else changed, so the
 * compositing, the floors and the pair collection are the shared instrument's.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The real gate walks every route in one process and throws
 * the moment a drive fails to reach its moment, which is correct: whatever is
 * on screen then is not the surface under audit. In this tree the reward
 * route belongs to another piece that is mid-edit, so the shared gate aborts
 * before it ever reaches #/pathway and this piece would have NO contrast
 * number at all. This runs the same audit over one route, named by ONLY, and
 * it is reported as what it is: my route, measured. The whole-app number is
 * the shared gate's to produce once that other route lands.
 *
 * WALL CLOCKS: none. The pathway route carries no wall-clock copy branch.

/**
 * WCAG contrast audit of the built app, measured from the rendered page.
 *
 * WHY THIS AND NOT A TOKEN TABLE. theme.css already reasons about contrast in
 * its comments, carefully, and it was still possible to ship a formal charge
 * sign in a literal #ffffff on a near white disc: the token table was right and
 * the component did not use it. A pair only fails where it is actually
 * composed, so the audit walks what the browser drew rather than what the
 * stylesheet declared. It is the same reason the capture script drives real
 * PointerEvents instead of trusting the state machine's own account.
 *
 * WHICH SURFACES. Eight tabs and the onboarding welcome are reachable by a
 * hash alone. The economy moments are not: the reward screen, the combo
 * interstitial and the graded answer strip only exist after a lesson has been
 * played, and one of them needs six days of history behind it. So a route here
 * is either a hash or a SEED plus a DRIVE, and the drives are the same ones
 * capture-economy.mjs uses, imported from economy-moments.mjs so the two cannot
 * drift. This matters more than it sounds: those three surfaces were built and
 * shipped without this audit ever having stood in front of them, and an
 * unvisited surface is an unmeasured one. A drive that does not reach its
 * moment aborts the run rather than reporting a screen nobody asked about.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES. Every element with visible text, and every SVG mark with a
 * fill or a stroke, on every tab, in both themes. For each one it resolves the
 * effective backdrop by climbing ancestors until something opaque, compositing
 * translucent layers on the way, and it treats a gradient backdrop as EVERY one
 * of its colour stops, reporting the worst. Floors are WCAG 2.1: 4.5 for body
 * text, 3.0 for large text (>= 24px, or >= 18.66px at weight 700+) and for
 * graphics and interface components per 1.4.11.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. Text over a photograph or a video frame, which this app
 * does not have yet; a mark whose backdrop is another mark rather than a styled
 * box, because the climb reads boxes; and whether a passing ratio is legible,
 * which is a different question from whether it is compliant. Anything it
 * cannot resolve is reported as UNRESOLVED and counted, never silently skipped:
 * a contrast audit that quietly drops what it cannot handle reads as a pass.
 *
 * Usage, from apps/web:
 *   npm run build
 *   node measurements/contrast-audit.mjs [--json]
 *
 * Exits nonzero when any pair is below its floor, so it can gate a build.
