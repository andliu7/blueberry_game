/**
 * The deck tray's fan: geometry a critic can hold a ruler to.
 *
 * The committed deck-tray image draws a symmetric hand of cards WHOLLY INSIDE
 * the phone frame AND READS EVERY NAME ON IT. Round 1 escaped the frame, so
 * this suite grew THE RULER, the exact fit inequality. Round 2 fitted and was
 * still wrong, because THE RULER was only an upper bound: the fan legally
 * squeezed to a 22 to 28px step against a 112px card and the critic measured
 * 10 to 14 percent of five of the six names visible. Fifteen tests were green
 * over a fan that read one word.
 *
 * So the suite now holds BOTH ends. THE FLOOR below is the second half, and
 * it asserts the property the critic actually measured: the visible band of
 * every dealt card contains that card's whole name box. It is written as the
 * geometry a DOM sampler would see (each card is overlapped from the right by
 * its successor, since z-index rises with index), not as a restatement of
 * tray.ts's own formula, so a change to that formula has to survive it.
