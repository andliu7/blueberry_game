/**
 * The deck tray's environment: the composition a critic can hold a ruler to.
 *
 * The background doctrine of 2026-09-02 makes this a checkable rule rather
 * than a matter of taste. "The environment is COMPOSED, never scattered...
 * props are placed by a deterministic per-unit placement table... Random
 * per-route scatter of icons or molecules is a defect a critic names." So the
 * three things worth asserting are exactly the three the doctrine states:
 * the table is fixed, every prop is inside the frame, and every prop is
 * somewhere a student can actually see it.
 *
 * The third is the one a review would miss. The scene settles its contents at
 * its foot, so what a prop has to clear is the fan and the tray rising from
 * there. A prop placed behind them is not a subtle prop, it is a prop that
 * never renders anywhere visible, and a screenshot on one viewport is a weak
 * way to notice that.
 *
 * ROUND 4 REPLACED THE OPACITY ASSERTION WITH A CONTRAST ONE, and the swap is
 * a strengthening rather than a trade. Round 3 drew every prop at 0.12, under
 * contrast-audit.mjs's own published <0.15 skip threshold, so the gate never
 * scored a mark on this face: it passed by not being measured, and what a
 * person saw was the grey-green sky the round 3 critic named. The props are
 * painted in the warm-tech families now, and this file computes the WCAG
 * ratio of each drawn line against the ground it sits on and holds it to the
 * 3.0 graphics floor. Skipping is no longer available to them.
