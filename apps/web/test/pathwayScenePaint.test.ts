/**
 * NOTHING IN THE LANDSCAPE IS DARKER THAN THE LAND.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. `.path-ridge` was rendered by PathScene as a bare
 * `<path>` and had no rule anywhere in pathway.css. An SVG shape with no
 * `fill` declared takes the SVG initial value, which is BLACK, so the far
 * hill silhouette painted pure #000000 over a third of the phone screen.
 * Measured on the built page before the fix: 8.11 percent of the scene at
 * scroll 0 and 5.68 percent at scroll 1000 were pixels with every channel
 * under 12, against zero such pixels in either adopted reference
 * (docs/reference/design-goals/units/unit01-path.jpg and unit02-path.jpg,
 * whose landscapes bottom out at mid-tan).
 *
 * WHY A SOURCE TEST AND NOT A SCREENSHOT. A screenshot test would catch this
 * one instance and would depend on a browser, a seed and a scroll position.
 * The DEFECT CLASS is narrower and fully decidable from the source: a scene
 * shape whose class carries no `fill` declaration falls through to an initial
 * value nobody chose. So this asserts two things, and the first is the one
 * that would have caught the bug on the day it was written:
 *
 *   1. EVERY class PathScene puts on an SVG shape has an explicit `fill` in
 *      pathway.css. A missing rule is the failure, not a dark colour.
 *   2. EVERY fill those classes resolve to is inside the terrace family's own
 *      range. "What the terrace family allows" is stated as a number below
 *      rather than left to taste.
 *
 * Both themes, because the night ramp is a ramp too and an unset fill is
 * black at night as well.
