/**
 * The onboarding flow, tested where it can be tested: the pure step model, the
 * gates, the course-outline reads, the charge pacing arithmetic, and the copy
 * contract. No JSX is exercised, because the suite runs in a node environment
 * with no DOM (vitest.config.ts), which is the same reason the frame components
 * carry no rules of their own: everything that can be got wrong lives in
 * flow.ts and copy.ts and is imported here directly.
 *
 * THE TESTS WORTH READING FIRST are the four that pin CONTRACTS rather than
 * examples, because those should survive any rewrite of the components above
 * them:
 *
 *   "the bar only ever moves forward"        the progress bar is monotone
 *                                            across every step and across every
 *                                            question inside the placement
 *   "every goal a student can pick fits      the offer cannot drift out of
 *    inside one full charge meter"           reach when an economy table moves
 *   "the overview is read from the course    no chemistry is retyped into the
 *    outline, never retyped"                 onboarding surface
 *   "every student facing line is marked     the human gate is visible in the
 *    for the human gate"                     product, not just in a comment
 *
 * NO WALL CLOCK IS READ ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE, and none is read by the module
 * under test. LOG.md's "The instruments that only worked before dark" records
 * two measurements that only passed before 18:00 because their subject branched
 * on the hour; flow.ts takes no clock at all and the placement view's only
 * timer is `performance.now()`, which is monotonic and has no calendar in it.
 * So every assertion here gives the same answer at 9am and at 11pm.
