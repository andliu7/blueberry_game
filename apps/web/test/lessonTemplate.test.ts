/**
 * The seven-slot lesson template and the recipe strip it draws.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS GUARDING, and it is three separate promises.
 *
 * 1. THE ORDERING. `docs/reference/design-goals/blueberry_spec-question-
 *    badges_*.png` shows a lesson's beat composition as its progress bar, and
 *    the composition is only meaningful if the ORDER is a rule rather than
 *    whatever order the content sources happened to be read in. So the slot
 *    list is asserted literally and a node carrying several kinds is asserted
 *    to plan them in slot order, not in authoring order.
 *
 * 2. THE RUN MACHINE. Recycle exists only once a miss has earned it, it never
 *    loops (loop discipline), and reward always closes. Each of those is a
 *    thing a future edit could quietly break, and none of them would show up
 *    as a crash: the lesson would just end in the wrong place.
 *
 * 3. EVERY BADGE HAS A MOTIF AND A LABEL. Owner ruling 4 of 2026-09-04 is
 *    that a chip with no content still shows what KIND it is, because an empty
 *    chip reads as broken. A badge kind added without a glyph, or without a
 *    label for the screen reader, is exactly that empty chip, so the suite
 *    holds both covers rather than the reviewer's eye.
 *
 * All of it is pure data in, data out. The web suite runs in node with no DOM,
 * which is the whole reason the ordering rules live in template.ts instead of
 * in JSX; this file is the payoff for that split.
