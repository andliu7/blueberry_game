/**
 * THE TRAIL AND THE BUTTONS SHARE ONE SCROLLING LAYER.
 *
 * This file exists because of a bug the owner reported twice: "every time I
 * scroll the path lags behind the buttons." docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md records the
 * root cause and it is architectural, not a tuning number:
 *
 *   "PathScene is a STICKY, viewport-sized SVG, and the trail is recomputed
 *   from node positions read with getBoundingClientRect inside a
 *   requestAnimationFrame on scroll. The compositor scrolls the nodes first
 *   and the callback moves the trail afterwards, so the trail is ALWAYS at
 *   least one frame behind. No amount of making that callback faster fixes
 *   it ... THE FIX IS TO TAKE JAVASCRIPT OUT OF THE LOOP."
 *
 * A frame-timing test cannot prove that fix, because a machine fast enough
 * hides a one-frame lag and a machine slow enough invents one. What CAN be
 * proved is the property the fix rests on, and it is a property of the
 * source: the element that draws the ribbon lives inside the same scrolling
 * section as the chips it connects, and NOTHING that draws trail geometry
 * runs on scroll. If both hold, the compositor moves the ribbon and the chips
 * together and there is no callback that could be late.
 *
 * EVERY ASSERTION HERE FAILS ON THE OLD ARCHITECTURE. Before this round the
 * trail was drawn inside PathScene.tsx, which carries three scroll listeners
 * and a requestAnimationFrame, and there was no per-unit trail element for a
 * section to contain. The live counterpart is
 * measurements/_probe-trail-lag.mjs, which scrolls a real browser and reports
 * the measured divergence.
 *
 * It reads source rather than rendering, which is the same reason the rest of
 * the pathway suite is pure: apps/web's vitest environment is `node`, and the
 * geometry decisions are the thing worth pinning either way.
