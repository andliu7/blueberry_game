/**
 * EVERY MCQ BEAT CARRIES A VISUAL.
 *
 * Owner ruling 1 of 2026-09-04: "a question that is only prose has already
 * lost the student", and it names every beat type rather than only the
 * curriculum player's. `src/beats/mcq/mcqFigures.ts` is the authored table
 * that makes it true for the beat runner, and the same discipline
 * `test/lessonFigures.test.ts` set applies here: the check walks the REAL
 * beat list, never the table's own key list, because a table proving itself
 * against itself would pass forever while a newly authored question shipped
 * as a wall of text.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not assert the chemistry. No
 * check here can tell 4-nitrophenol from 3-nitrophenol, and one that
 * pretended to would teach a reviewer to stop reading. The chemistry in that
 * file is authored and reviewed by a person, exactly as packages/feedback's
 * copy is. What is mechanised is COVERAGE (every beat has a visual), KEYING
 * (no visual is authored against a beat id that does not exist, which is what
 * catches a rename), and the drawing INVARIANTS that would silently produce a
 * broken picture.
