/**
 * The rank-up moment's model.
 *
 * A RANK UP IS THE PACKAGE'S DECISION, NOT THIS SURFACE'S. `receiptFor`
 * compares the FLOOR rank before and after one event, because the floor is what
 * the badge and the award are keyed to, and this model only reads that verdict.
 * So every case below runs a real journal through `receiptFor` rather than
 * asserting against a receipt written by hand, with exactly one documented
 * exception at the bottom.
 *
 * THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS MOST IS THE LABEL ONE. The model reads the award
 * out of the receipt's own diamond lines by their "New rank: " prefix, which is
 * a string agreement between two files. A test that only checked the number
 * would pass while the moment silently stopped showing an award, because a
 * renamed label parses to zero lines and zero diamonds and no exception. So the
 * prefix is asserted against a real receipt, and it is the tripwire for anyone
 * editing `receiptFor`'s wording.
