/**
 * EVERY SKETCH FITS INSIDE ITS OWN VIEWBOX. Read this header before deciding
 * this suite is strange, because the way it works is unusual on purpose.
 *
 * THE DEFECT IT PINS was measured in the running build by the round 3 critic,
 * not imagined here. `Acid` set its "OH" at x=44 with SVG's default
 * `text-anchor: start` at fontSize 9, so the label painted out to about x=55
 * inside a box 52 wide: the H was sliced down its middle and the Carbonyls
 * tile rendered its label as "Ol". `Thiol` had the identical fault at x=43,
 * and `Ketone` had the neighbouring one, a bare C=O double bond drawn with no
 * oxygen on the end of it, so the Reaction Deck tile showed two floating
 * parallel strokes reading as "II". None of the three is a chemistry error
 * and none of them broke a render; they are the kind of thing only a person
 * looking at the pixels catches, which is exactly why they need a check.
 *
 * WHY IT READS THE SOURCE FILE. apps/web/vitest.config.ts runs in a node
 * environment over `test/**\/*.test.ts` and its header says why: the pure
 * layers are unit tested and the React components are judged at the human
 * gate. That is the right split and this suite does not reopen it. But a
 * table of label positions living beside the drawing would be a COPY of the
 * drawing, and deckTray.test.ts already carries the lesson about copies in
 * its own words: "the stated bound is the painted bound", written after a
 * constant drifted away from the chrome it was supposed to describe.
 *
 * So this reads the coordinates out of the file that paints them. There is
 * one source of truth, it is the drawing itself, and a sketch that grows a
 * label past the edge fails here whatever anybody wrote in a comment.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody trusts it further than it goes: it
 * checks anchor points, not rendered glyph rasters, and it treats a label's
 * width as a conservative advance estimate rather than a measured one. It
 * will catch a label placed off the edge. It will not catch a font that
 * renders wider than the estimate.
