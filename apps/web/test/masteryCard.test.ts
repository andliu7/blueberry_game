/**
 * The mastery rank card's model, against real snapshots from real journals.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE BUILDS AN EconomySnapshot BY HAND, and nothing here reads the
 * host clock. Every case is a journal plus an explicit `now`, run through
 * `deriveEconomy`, for the two reasons the charge meter's tests already record:
 * a threshold that moves in packages/economy shows up as a failing sentence
 * rather than a fixture that quietly still passes, and a test that ran green in
 * the morning cannot go red after dark. That second half is the rule this run
 * learned the hard way; see apps/web/measurements/gauntlet-economy/LOG.md,
 * "The instruments that only worked before dark".
 *
 * THE THREE LOAD BEARING BLOCKS ARE THE LAST THREE, and each one is a clause
 * docs/ECONOMY.md calls non-optional rather than a preference:
 *
 *   "Ranks have a floor"  is proved by decaying a real journal until the visible
 *   score falls out of the band that earned the badge, and asserting the badge
 *   did not move. That clause is the one ECONOMY.md calls "the most demoralizing
 *   thing this system could do" if broken, so it is proved on a journal rather
 *   than on a hand-made snapshot that could assert itself.
 *
 *   "Never render decay as a loss"  is proved structurally: the model exposes no
 *   field a view could draw a fall from. A test that only checked today's copy
 *   would pass again the moment someone added `delta`, so the assertion is over
 *   the model's own key set.
 *
 *   "Cap the visible dip"  is proved by never reading `mastery.score`. The card
 *   shows `visible`, which the engine has already capped; a card that read the
 *   raw model number would show a harsher fall than the engine intends and no
 *   copy check would catch it.
