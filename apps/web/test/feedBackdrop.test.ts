/**
 * The Feed's composed ground, held to the BACKGROUND DOCTRINE as a check
 * rather than as a comment.
 *
 * docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md, owner direction 2026-09-02: "the environment is
 * COMPOSED, never scattered ... props are placed by a deterministic per-unit
 * placement table ... Random per-route scatter of icons or molecules is a
 * defect a critic names." A doctrine nothing can fail is a doctrine that will
 * be broken by the next builder who reaches for Math.random because a
 * composition looked too regular, so the properties below are the ones a
 * critic would actually check: that the table is the same table every time,
 * that nothing sits under the content column, and that every prop is a member
 * of the declared family.
 *
 * THERE IS NO CLOCK HERE ON PURPOSE. measurements/gauntlet-economy/LOG.md's
 * wall-clock lesson is that a surface which reads the host clock cannot be
 * asserted; this table takes no arguments at all, which is the strongest form
 * of the same property, and the determinism block below is what pins it.
