/**
 * The mistake to card bridge, the save choreography, and what the toast puts on
 * screen.
 *
 * These are the parts of cards/Recommendation.tsx that can be wrong SILENTLY. A
 * toast that looks fine can still be handing the review queue a card whose
 * explanation nobody reviewed, or a card whose id changes every session so its
 * interval history belongs to nothing, or a NaN transform that drops the whole
 * animation without an error anywhere.
 *
 * THE CHOREOGRAPHY IS TESTED AS A FUNCTION, not through a browser. Three of the
 * four ways the save can be wrong are invisible on screen: firing twice, firing
 * at the press instead of at the landing, and being lost when the toast is torn
 * down mid flight. startSaveRun takes its timers as a parameter for exactly
 * that reason, so those three are ordinary assertions with fake timers.
 *
 * THE MARKUP IS TESTED THROUGH renderToStaticMarkup. apps/web has no jsdom and
 * no testing-library (see the integration notes), and react-dom/server runs in
 * node today, so the first render is assertable now rather than after a
 * dependency lands: what the student reads, which controls exist, and that the
 * toast names none of our own data structures at them. Click handling and the
 * :active press are the parts that still need a DOM; the press is held by the
 * stylesheet assertion at the foot of this file instead.
 *
 * The copy tests deliberately assert IDENTITY with the authored registries
 * rather than asserting the text reads well. CLAUDE.md forbids promoting
 * generated copy to authored copy, and the only mechanical way to hold that
 * line is to prove every student facing string came out of packages/feedback or
 * out of the authored distractor table character for character.
