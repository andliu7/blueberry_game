/**
 * The three geometry and honesty claims this design round is judged on.
 *
 * ONE, THE DIAMOND DOES NOT CROSS ITSELF. docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md is explicit
 * that "a trail that visibly diverges from its nodes is a failing bug, never
 * an art-direction question", and blueberry_branch-diamond draws the two arms
 * bowing OUTWARD and converging on the unit gate without touching. A critic
 * reproduced the opposite at 390 by 844: the arms crossed in a visible X just
 * above the Unit 1 arch. The proof here is stronger than sampling the curve,
 * because a Bezier lies inside the convex hull of its control points: if every
 * control point of the left arm stays at or left of the centreline, no point
 * of the drawn curve can be right of it, and the two arms can meet only at the
 * endpoints they share.
 *
 * TWO, A SIDE LOOP IS A LOOP. The goals name the vocabulary "dimmed SIDE
 * LOOPS" and blueberry_r7-compiled-v2 draws one as a solid thin trail that
 * LEAVES the road and rejoins it. The build drew a straight stub to a dead end.
 * The claim asserted is the one that makes it a loop rather than a stub: both
 * ends land ON the spine, and the detour reaches its own chip on the way.
 *
 * THREE, A GATE MAY NOT CLAIM PROGRESS OVER CONTENT NOBODY HAS SEEN. With
 * Unit 1 cleared, Unit 2's gate reported "passed" while every node inside
 * Unit 2 was locked or unauthored, because a unit with no authored nodes is
 * never marked active and fell straight through the ordering test. Green says
 * "you moved" per the palette rules, so this is a correctness claim about a
 * progress statement and not a styling one.
 *
 * pathwayState.test.ts encodes the map model and stays untouched, per the
 * brief; this file adds claims that live above it.
 *
 * WALL CLOCKS: none. Every input here is a literal or pure geometry, so this
 * suite measures the same at 09:00 and at 23:00
 * (measurements/gauntlet-economy/LOG.md, "The instruments that only worked
 * before dark").
