/**
 * The lesson's green: how far it has travelled, and where it is allowed to
 * appear at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM lessonTemplate.test.ts. That file
 * guards the template's ORDERING and its run machine. This one guards two
 * promises about the goal green specifically, both of which a critic measured
 * as broken on the previous build and neither of which any existing test
 * could have caught:
 *
 *   1. THE GREEN NEVER RUNS OVER A MISS. `recipeProgress` is the length of
 *      the strip's green capsule, and it takes a CLEARED fraction. The
 *      previous build handed the strip the ANSWERED fraction, so a wrong
 *      answer filled the current segment solid green while the panel
 *      underneath said "Not yet". DESIGN-GOALS is that "green says you
 *      moved" and the committed badge sheet reserves the green fill for
 *      cleared beats, so a miss moves the position and not the colour.
 *
 *   2. THE GREEN IS NEVER A LINE. DESIGN-GOALS' FILL-ONLY rule: the goal
 *      green is 1.60:1 on cream, so it appears "ONLY as a fill carrying dark
 *      ink or a white check on a large shape, never as text, never as a
 *      hairline". Two separate green hairlines shipped anyway, one on the
 *      strip's done segment (#a7cd8e on #cfe7b6, 1.34:1) and one on the
 *      correct-answer option tile (#75b49e on #d1fae5, 1.9:1), and in the
 *      first case a file header asserted the opposite of what the file's own
 *      pixels did. A comment cannot hold that rule; a check reading the
 *      stylesheet can.
 *
 * The second test is a TEXT check on a stylesheet rather than a computed
 * style, because the web suite runs in node with no DOM and no CSS engine.
 * That makes it a coarse instrument and it is written to be coarse in the
 * safe direction: it looks for a green token inside a border or outline
 * declaration, which is the exact shape of both defects, and it will not
 * catch a green line drawn some other way. It is a floor, not a proof.
