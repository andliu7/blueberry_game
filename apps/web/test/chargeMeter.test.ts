/**
 * The charge meter's model, against real snapshots from real journals.
 *
 * Nothing here builds an EconomySnapshot by hand and nothing here reads the
 * host clock. Every case is a journal plus an explicit `now`, run through
 * `deriveEconomy`, so a price that moves in packages/economy shows up as a
 * failing sentence rather than as a fixture that quietly still passes, and a
 * test that ran green in the morning cannot go red after dark. That second half
 * is a rule this run learned the hard way and wrote down: see
 * `apps/web/measurements/gauntlet-economy/LOG.md`, "The instruments that only
 * worked before dark".
 *
 * THE TWO LOAD BEARING BLOCKS ARE THE LAST TWO.
 *
 * `mistakes never cost charge` is docs/ECONOMY.md's Charge rule 2, which that
 * file calls "load bearing. Do not let this drift", and which
 * docs/THREE-TEACHERS.md then corroborates from outside: the bar's newer energy
 * system deducts on every question, right or wrong, and is reported as feeling
 * more restrictive than the hearts it replaced. The economy package proves the
 * arithmetic; this block proves the PICTURE, which is where a student would
 * actually see a change. It appends wrong attempts and asserts the meter is
 * drawn identically, down to the sentence under it.
 *
 * `the exam window replaces the meter` is the other one. ECONOMY.md switches
 * Charge off for the fortnight before the exam and calls that "the whole
 * ethical argument for the mechanic in one gesture", and a meter drawn full is
 * still a meter a student counts. So the assertion is not that the fill is 1,
 * it is that there is NOTHING TO FILL: no fractions, no flask liquid, no glow,
 * and a badge in its place.
