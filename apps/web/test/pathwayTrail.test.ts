/**
 * The trail's arithmetic: the drawn ribbon, the diamond fork's geometry, the
 * F1 pill's miniature, and the terrace bands. All pure functions over points
 * and numbers, so the geometry the scene draws is testable without a
 * document, which is the same reason terrain.ts and pathwayLayout.ts are
 * tested and PathScene.tsx is not.
 *
 * The rules asserted here are the committed ones:
 *  - blueberry_branch-diamond_1788284291.png: the fork's arms leave the
 *    concept node and REJOIN at the unit gate; no direct spine connection
 *    crosses the diamond
 *  - the FILL-ONLY green (docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md): the green ends at the JOIN,
 *    which is the last node on a chain the student has reached, so the road
 *    behind them is walked and the road ahead is not, and a loop detour is
 *    never done because enrichment is not progress
 *  - the track-map pill draws the unit's REAL shape: same wind function,
 *    completed stretch a literal prefix of the whole
