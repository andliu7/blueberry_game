/**
 * The lesson banks what the student earned.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. On 2026-09-05 a verifier finished #/lesson/u1-kvt at
 * 1 of 1 correct and then diffed localStorage: it was byte-identical. No
 * lesson recorded, no diamonds, no streak, the pathway header still reading
 * "0 of 86 lessons done", the node still open, the trail never turning green.
 * The Path tab, the product's first destination, could not advance a student
 * one step, and it had been that way through several green suites.
 *
 * The cause was not a broken function. `clearNode` worked. It had NO CALLERS
 * ANYWHERE IN THE APP, while `startNode` beside it was already spending
 * charge to enter a node. The store took payment on the way in and banked
 * nothing on the way out, and every existing test passed the whole time
 * because each one tested a piece that was individually correct.
 *
 * That is the regression class this file guards: not "is the arithmetic
 * right" but "is anything calling it at all". Two checks, deliberately
 * different in kind.
 *
 * THE FIRST IS A MACHINE TEST and proves the run actually reaches the state
 * that triggers banking. If `reportStep` stopped producing a "reward" phase,
 * the banking would never fire and no source check would notice.
 *
 * THE SECOND IS A TEXT CHECK ON SOURCE, the same coarse instrument and the
 * same reason lessonProgress.test.ts records for its stylesheet check: the
 * web suite runs in node with no DOM, and BeatRunner banks inside a React
 * effect behind a dynamic import that cannot be driven here. It is a floor,
 * not a proof. It cannot tell whether the call runs, only that the app has
 * not gone back to never making it. That is precisely the state the product
 * shipped in, so it is the state worth a tripwire.
