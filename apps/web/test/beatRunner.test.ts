/**
 * The adapter between the pathway's node ids and the five beat surfaces.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS GUARDING. BeatRunner carries a hand written table mapping
 * three pathway nodes onto three sort ladders, because the ladders are keyed on
 * curriculum topic ids rather than on node ids. A hand written table is a
 * liability the moment someone renames a ladder, and the failure would be
 * silent: the node would simply stop being playable and the coverage number
 * would quietly drop. So every id in that table is resolved here against the
 * real content.
 *
 * The second thing guarded is the claim the pathway makes to the student. A
 * node linked on the map promises a lesson. If resolveBeat returns null for a
 * node the map links, the map is lying, and the test below is what catches it.
