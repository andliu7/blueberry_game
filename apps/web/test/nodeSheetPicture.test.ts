/**
 * ONE ASSERTION PER MEASURED DIVERGENCE, so no finding on the attempt 2

 *
 * The critic put the goal images beside the running screen and named fourteen
 * places where the build was a different design rather than a near miss. Each
 * one is a static property of the stylesheet or the component, so each one is
 * checkable here, the same way pathwaySheetContract.test.ts and
 * canvasBackdrop.test.ts hold their surfaces: read the source, strip the
 * comments so a check reads code and never the prose describing it, assert.
 *
 * These are NOT a substitute for the blind critic, who still judges the
 * rendered look against blueberry_r5-node-sheet-v2_1788286114.png and
 * blueberry_r5-guidebook_1788286119.png. They are the ratchet under it.
 *
 * The image coordinates quoted throughout were re-taken from the committed
 * files, not copied from the critic's report; pathway-sheet.css's header
