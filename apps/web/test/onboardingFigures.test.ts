/**
 * THE PLACEMENT'S DRAWN CHEMISTRY, AND THE ONE THING THAT MAKES IT SAFE.
 *
 * Owner ruling 2026-09-04: "EVERY QUESTION CARRIES A VISUAL", and "OPTION
 * CARDS ARE PICTURES WITH CAPTIONS, not captions with pictures". The placement
 * quiz is the one onboarding screen where a real chemistry question appears,
 * so it is the one screen that ruling actually binds, and a previous pass
 * shipped it as prose on the true observation that `ChoiceOption` in
 * packages/curriculum is `{ id, text }` with no figure field.
 *
 * The figures are therefore authored in apps/web/src/onboarding/figures.ts,
 * keyed by the corpus's own `problemId::optionId` pairs, as an explicit shim
 * until that field exists. THIS FILE IS WHAT KEEPS THAT HONEST. A hand written
 * table beside a corpus it does not live in is exactly the kind of thing that
 * silently goes stale: a new question is authored, nobody remembers the table,
 * and a student meets a bare word on the screen that was supposed to be the
 * proof the ruling was implemented.
 *
 * So the coverage test does not read a list of ids. It DRIVES THE REAL QUIZ
 * MACHINE, every claimed course by every answer pattern, collects the problems
 * the walk can actually serve, and asserts a figure for every option of every
 * choice question among them. Add a question to SEED_CORPUS with no figure and
 * this goes red; delete an option and the orphan check goes red the other way.
 *
 * NO WALL CLOCK IS READ HERE AND NONE IS READ BY THE SUBJECT. `elapsedSeconds`
 * is supplied as event data exactly as the shell supplies it, which is what
 * LOG.md's "The instruments that only worked before dark" asks of anything
 * that measures a surface: this file gives the same answer at 9am and at 11pm.
