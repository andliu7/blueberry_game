/**
 * The structure sketches on the deck tiles and the fanned cards.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR is one the round 2 critic measured in
 * the running build rather than one anybody guessed: `doodleFor` is a hash
 * over the deck id, and a hash collides, so "EAS Reactions" and "My mistakes"
 * drew the identical Br-branched sketch on the landing grid and "Grignard"
 * and "Ozonolysis" drew an identical one inside a single fan. Both committed
 * goal images draw every visible structure distinct (four different sketches
 * on four tiles, six on six cards), so a repeat where the reference is
 * all-distinct is what makes the surface look templated.
 *
 * `distinctDoodles` is the fix and these are its bounds: no repeat inside one
 * rendered set, the same set always resolves the same way, and a deck keeps
 * its own hashed face wherever nothing else has taken it.
