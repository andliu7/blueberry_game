/**
 * The celebration's model: the P2 law, and the accuracy chip the S3 judge asked
 * for.
 *
 * THE LAW UNDER TEST, from RewardMoment.tsx's own header and from the S3 verdict
 * in measurements/gauntlet-economy/LOG.md: the hero number appears ONCE and the
 * itemization sums to it exactly. That is the specific thing the blind judge
 * picked us for over the bar ("the reward screen itemizes its headline number,
 * First clear +10, Flawless +5, Daily goal +10, summing exactly to the 25
 * shown"), and until now nothing failed if a builder broke it. A screen that
 * shows a number its own chips do not add up to is the one defect this surface
 * cannot afford, so it is asserted here rather than looked at.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE HAND BUILDS A RECEIPT. Every case is a journal and an event
 * through the real `receiptFor`, the same standard feedModel.test.ts and
 * streakModel.test.ts hold themselves to: a rule that moves in packages/economy
 * shows up as a failing celebration rather than as a fixture that quietly still
 * passes.
 *
 * THE CLOCK IS PART OF THE SURFACE (LOG.md). Every case pins `now`, and the
 * last block runs one journal at 09:00 and at 23:00 to prove the celebration's
 * own numbers do not branch on the hour the way the header's streak copy does.
