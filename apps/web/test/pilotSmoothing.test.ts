/**
 * The pilot drag smoother, held to the two numbers it publishes.
 *
 * The module's whole claim is that it can be fast and calm at once: no
 * perceptible lag while the hand is moving, and a stable arc once it stops. A
 * fixed-lag smoother cannot make both claims, so the tests here have to check
 * both or they check nothing.
 *
 * Every timestamp in this file is synthetic. The smoother reads no clock and
 * owns no timer, which is exactly why settling time is assertable in a node
 * environment: "180 ms" here is 11 frames of arithmetic, not a wait.
