/**
 * The third and fourth mascot axes: state and costume.
 *
 * Three things are checked here and each one guards a different failure.
 *
 * 1. The COMPOSITION RULES in berryState.ts. Sway and blush are the only two
 *    numbers a state and a mood both have an opinion about, and they resolve
 *    differently on purpose (sway is won outright, blush adds). A silent swap
 *    of those two rules would look plausible in a diff and would make an
 *    aromatic berry sway, which is the one thing aromatic means.
 *
 * 2. The 31 WANTED STATES from docs/MASCOT.md, as a table. The doc's claim is
 *    that 21 of the 31 are compositions of code that already shipped, 6 need
 *    one new state each and 4 are deferred. That claim is only true while
 *    every mood, behaviour and state it names still exists under that name, so
 *    the table asserts each row against the three registries and the group
 *    counts against the doc's own summary. If somebody renames a mood, this is
 *    what says which of the 31 design states just stopped being expressible.
 *
 * 3. NIGHTCAP IS NOT AN IN-APP COSTUME. MASCOT.md: "Notification art only,
 *    never an in-app state". That is a rule about a map's range, which is
 *    exactly the kind of rule a test can hold and a comment cannot.
 *
 * Plus a contrast check on the badge's token pair, because the state work adds
 * the first new visible glyph since a literal white sign shipped on a near
 * white disc (STATUS.md, 2026-08-27). The check reads the tokens out of
 * theme.css and measures them, rather than trusting the comment beside them.
