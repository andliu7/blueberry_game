/**
 * Lesson decks are generated, not authored.
 *
 * The claim is that a lesson deck costs nothing, because the beats already
 * carry a prompt, an authored answer and a reason. These tests hold the claim
 * to each beat kind in turn, and they pin the two kinds that deliberately
 * produce NO card. That second half matters more than the first: a silent
 * omission would show up as a deck that is shorter than its lesson and nobody
 * would know why.
