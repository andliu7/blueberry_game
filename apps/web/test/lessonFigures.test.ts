/**
 * EVERY QUESTION A LESSON SERVES CARRIES A VISUAL.
 *
 * Owner ruling 1 of 2026-09-04: "a question that is only prose has already
 * lost the student". `src/lesson/lessonFigures.ts` is the authored table that
 * makes that true, and a table is only as good as the thing that notices when
 * the corpus outgrows it. So this walks the REAL served corpus rather than
 * the table's own key list: the table proving itself against itself would
 * pass forever while a newly authored question shipped as a wall of text.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not assert the chemistry. No
 * check here can tell 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene from 2,3-dimethylbut-1-ene, and
 * one that pretended to would be a check that teaches a reviewer to stop
 * reading. The chemistry in that file is authored and reviewed by a person,
 * exactly as `packages/feedback`'s copy is. What is mechanised is COVERAGE
 * (every served question has a scheme, every candidate has a picture),
 * KEYING (no figure is authored against a problem or an option id the corpus
 * does not have, which is what catches a rename) and the drawing INVARIANTS
 * that would silently produce a broken picture.
