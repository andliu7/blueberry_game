/**
 * Mastery, the retention fraction the deck tiles and the fanned cards draw.
 *
 * THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS: mastery is derived from the scheduler's own
 * interval and nothing else, so the thin green bar can never disagree with
 * the schedule it summarises. The ramp's two edges are pinned, the learning
 * boundary against the scheduler's own GRADUATING_INTERVAL_DAYS rather than
 * a copied literal, and the last dot is asserted unearned until maturity,
 * because 4.6 dots drawn as 5 is a promise the schedule has not kept.
