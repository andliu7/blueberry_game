/**
 * The mastery denominator, as the WEB SHELL supplies it.
 *
 * @blueberry/economy scores mastery out of a course universe the caller hands
 * in, and falls back to the unlocked set floored at
 * MASTERY_MIN_UNIVERSE_DIFFICULTY when nobody names one. The package's own tests
 * prove that arithmetic. What they cannot prove is the thing that actually broke:
 * whether THIS shell hands in a universe whose node ids are the ids it journals.
 *
 * The bug. LessonPlayer finishes a lesson by calling completeLesson, which
 * appends the attempts and one node_cleared. It never appends node_started, so
 * the economy saw one node unlocked and one node cleared: 100 percent mastery,
 * rank Exam Ready, and a receipt paying every rank award for a single lesson.
 * A universe built from ids that did not match the journal's would look correct
 * and reintroduce the same bug quietly, which is why the first test here compares
 * the two id sets rather than trusting them to agree.
