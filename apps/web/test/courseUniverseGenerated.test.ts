/**
 * The generated mastery universe against the real curriculum.
 *
 * src/app/courseUniverse.generated.ts is a precomputed copy of the course graph,
 * written by scripts/gen-course-universe.mjs. It exists because progress.ts is
 * reachable from the shell and therefore ships in the game route's entry chunk:
 * importing @blueberry/curriculum there dragged the whole authored corpus into
 * the initial payload, 176.4 KB gzipped to 260.9 KB in one commit.
 *
 * A precomputed table is a copy, and a copy drifts. This test is what makes the
 * copy safe: it reads the corpus the same way the generator does and fails the
 * moment the two disagree. A red run here means run the generator, never edit
 * the table by hand.
