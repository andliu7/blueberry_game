/**
 * The scheduler is the retention engine, so these tests are the deliverable as
 * much as the code is. They pin three things: what each of the four buttons
 * does to the interval, that `again` comes back inside the session without
 * throwing the ease away, and where the "due today" line actually falls.
 *
 * Every case passes its own `now`. Nothing here waits, and nothing here is
 * flaky at midnight.
