/**
 * The arrow landing rule, and the defect that produced it.
 *
 * Round seven's captures showed the leaving group arrow as a vertical stub over
 * the middle of the C-Br bond, pointing back down at the bond and never
 * touching bromine: it read as electrons flowing INTO the bond rather than out
 * of it with the leaving group, which is the opposite of the chemistry.
 *
 * The cause was arithmetic, not taste. The landing was the rim point facing the
 * source, offset by a flat 16 unit clearance. Bromine's radius is 21 and the
 * bond's midpoint is 38 from its centre, so 21 + 16 = 37 put the landing 0.8
 * units from where the arrow started, and bowAwayFrom treats a chord under 1 as
 * degenerate and bows straight up.
 *
 * These cases are the general shape of that bug, not the one instance, so they
 * hold whatever the demo step's layout does later.
