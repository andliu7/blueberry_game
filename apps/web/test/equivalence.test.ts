/**
 * The owner's EAS report, turned into a test, plus the guard against the fix
 * being too generous.
 *
 * Two directions matter here and they are not symmetric in cost. Rejecting a
 * right answer is unfair and generates support mail. ACCEPTING A WRONG ONE
 * teaches bad chemistry, which CLAUDE.md treats as the more serious failure.
 * So most of this file is about the second: proving that the equivalence rule
 * merges the nitronium oxygens and nothing else.
