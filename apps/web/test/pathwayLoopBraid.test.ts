/**
 * The side loops braid, and no mid-unit node ever renders locked.
 *
 * TWO CLAIMS, both from docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md, and both asserted POSITIVELY
 * rather than by checking that a particular bad case is absent.
 *
 * ONE: "Winding trail, never a straight central spine", together with the
 * background doctrine's "composed, never scattered" and "at most one fork
 * visible per screen".
 *
 * THE ALTERNATION CLAIM THAT USED TO BE HERE IS SUPERSEDED, and it is worth
 * saying why rather than deleting it quietly. Attempt 2 answered a column of
 * four stacked chips by ALTERNATING the sides of a run, which unstacked the
 * column and drew a braid instead: four chips either side of the road, each
 * with its own closed oval off its own stretch of spine. A critic measured
 * that as "four simultaneous forks at scrollY 0 and 2800, and six at scrollY
 * 4200" and named the braid as outside the three shapes the branch
 * vocabulary has. So a run now stays on ONE side and BOWS, trail.ts threads
 * the whole run onto one mouth, and runs are capped and spaced. The positive
 * assertions for all of that live in pathwayBranchDensity.test.ts; what stays
 * here is the claim this file can make on its own, that the SPINE winds.
 *
 * TWO: the unlock policy, owner ruling 2026-09-01. "Reactions within a unit
 * are freely orderable. Branch nodes carry no locks; only UNIT GATES lock."
 * pathwayUnlock.test.ts already sweeps the two derivation functions; this
 * file adds the claim over the SHAPE the tab actually lays out, which is the
 * half a derivation test cannot see: a node can be unlocked in the model and
 * still be handed to the renderer inside a unit that is drawn shut.
 *
 * pathwayState.test.ts encodes the model and stays untouched, per the brief.
 *
 * WALL CLOCKS: none. Every journal timestamp below is a fixed literal and
 * every other input is pure geometry, so this suite measures the same at
 * 09:00 and at 23:00 (measurements/gauntlet-economy/LOG.md, "The instruments
 * that only worked before dark").
