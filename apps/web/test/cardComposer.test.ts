/**
 * The composer's logic: the three sides, the derived classic faces, and the
 * words a blocked save shows.
 *
 * TWO PROPERTIES CARRY THE SURFACE. The mapping (front is the setup, back is
 * the product, why carries the conditions) is what keeps a three-sided card
 * whole on every surface that predates sides, export and CSV included, so it
 * is pinned exactly. And the blocked-save copy is coach voice by rule, not by
 * taste: no scolding constructions and no rhetorical questions, which is
 * mechanical enough to assert.
