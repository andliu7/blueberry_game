/**
 * Sort the cards: the logic under the drag.
 *
 * WHAT IS WORTH TESTING HERE AND WHAT IS NOT. The React component is judged by
 * eye and measured by the frame and contrast scripts, per the note at the top
 * of vitest.config.ts, so nothing below renders JSX. What IS worth pinning is
 * everything the component delegates to: the board invariant that no gesture
 * may ever lose a card, the grading translation that decides whether a student
 * is told "wrong" or "the right ladder, upside down", and the professor
 * adjustable pKa layer, whose whole job is to flag a contradiction rather than
 * teach one.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT, stated once because four tests lean on it: rungs plus pool
 * always hold every card exactly once. A drag that drops a card on an occupied
 * rung, a keyboard nudge off the end of the track, a tap that swaps two rungs:
 * none of them may duplicate or delete a card. That is fuzzed rather than
 * argued, over a random walk of every move the surface can make.
