/**
 * A forming-bond site is never offered THROUGH another atom.
 *
 * The bug this pins, reported by the owner in the first minute of dragging on
 * the real canvas: hydroxide attacking bromomethane lays out linearly, O-C-Br,
 * and with the oxygen armed a betweenAtomsSite was offered for every unbonded
 * pair, (O, C) and (O, Br) both. The (O, Br) site is centred on the midpoint of
 * O and Br, which in a linear layout sits exactly ON the carbon. So a drag from
 * the oxygen toward the carbon entered the (O, Br) site's circle before it ever
 * reached the carbon, that site won the hit test, and the arrow snapped to
 * bromine. "Which shouldn't even be allowed" is the correct reading: a sigma
 * bond cannot form through the middle of another atom.
 *
 * The same phantom site is what a blind critic in round 8 described as a dashed
 * line crossing the carbon and continuing onto the C-Br bond, read as a second
 * electron path toward the bond that breaks. One bug, two sightings.
