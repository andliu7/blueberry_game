/**
 * The Charge sheet's model, against real snapshots from real journals.
 *
 * Nothing here builds an EconomySnapshot by hand. Every case runs a journal
 * through `deriveEconomy`, so a price that moves in packages/economy shows up
 * as a failing sentence rather than as a fixture that quietly still passes.
 * Same rule hudModel.test.ts is written under, and the same reason.
 *
 * THE LOAD BEARING TEST IS THE LAST BLOCK. docs/ECONOMY.md's Charge table says
 * a wrong answer costs 0 and calls the row "load bearing. Do not let this
 * drift", and the Supersession section lists "Charge never pricing a mistake"
 * among the mitigations that must not be stripped one at a time. The economy
 * package proves the arithmetic; this file proves the SURFACE, which is where a
 * student would actually see a change: it appends wrong attempts to a journal
 * and asserts the whole model, every number and every sentence, is unchanged.
 * "Never show a charge change anywhere" is a claim about what is on screen, so
 * it is tested against what the screen is told to draw.
