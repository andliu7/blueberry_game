/**
 * The streak screen's model, against real journals run through the real engine.
 *
 * Nothing here hand builds an EconomySnapshot or a Receipt. Every case is a
 * journal, `deriveEconomy` and `receiptFor`, so a rule that moves in
 * packages/economy shows up here as a failing sentence rather than as a fixture
 * that quietly still passes. Same standard as hudModel.test.ts.
 *
 * The case this file exists for is the third one: a run with a REST DAY inside
 * it. That is the one the naive strip gets wrong, because a rest day bridges a
 * gap without adding to `current`, so counting backwards from the day number
 * lights a square the student did not earn and hides the one the app gave them.
