/**
 * Which question types a student can actually reach.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `BUILT_BEAT_KINDS` read ["mechanism", "resonance"]
 * with a comment calling them "the two the trainer already plays today", long
 * after mcq, match, sort and synthesis had shipped with 102, 30, 22 and 54
 * authored items behind them. Nothing consumed the constant, so nothing went
 * red; any coverage report built on it would have described a product two
 * thirds smaller than the one that exists.
 *
 * The same audit found the opposite error next to it. `trace` has 88 authored
 * items, a complete TraceBeatView and a barrel exporting it, and no importer
 * anywhere: planLesson never schedules a trace step and BeatRunner has no
 * branch that renders one. Content a student cannot reach counts as shipped in
 * a list that says "built" and does not check.
 *
 * So this file makes the list answerable to the code. It reads the two files
 * that actually decide what plays, and fails when they and the constant
 * disagree in either direction: a kind claimed as built with no branch to
 * render it, or a kind rendered somewhere that the constant does not admit.
 *
 * A TEXT CHECK ON SOURCE, for the reason lessonProgress.test.ts states for its
 * stylesheet check: the web suite runs in node with no DOM, so a runner cannot
 * be mounted and asked. It is a floor, not a proof. It cannot tell whether a
 * branch is reachable at runtime, only whether one is written at all, which is
 * exactly the state both defects above were in.
