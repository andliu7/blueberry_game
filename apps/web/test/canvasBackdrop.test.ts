/**
 * The backdrop's one real risk is that it steals a pointer from the arrow
 * machine, so that is what most of this file is about.
 *
 * The stylesheet assertions are not decoration either. A background that
 * animates a layout property drops the canvas off the compositor and takes the
 * 60 fps row in CLAUDE.md's budgets table with it, and a background that takes
 * pointer events breaks drawing outright. Both are invisible in review and
 * obvious in a test.
