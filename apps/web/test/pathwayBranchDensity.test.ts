/**
 * THE BRANCH VOCABULARY HAS THREE SHAPES, and this file holds the layout to
 * them. Every claim is positive: it asserts what the goals require, not that
 * some particular bad case is absent.
 *
 * docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md, the pathway section:
 *
 *   "Branch vocabulary: DIAMOND fork is the default unit shape ... HUB with
 *    petals is reserved ... Dimmed SIDE LOOPS mark application and enrichment
 *    lessons"
 *   "At most one fork visible per screen, and all nodes the same size"
 *   "THE TRAIL IS CODE, ALWAYS: it is derived from the node layout so it
 *    follows the buttons by construction. A trail that visibly diverges from
 *    its nodes is a failing bug"
 *
 * A critic measured three separate failures of those clauses on the built
 * page and each one has an assertion here:
 *
 *   1. "four simultaneous forks at scrollY 0 and 2800, and six at scrollY
 *      4200". The cause was one detour per enrichment chip. A run is capped
 *      and runs are spaced, and trail.ts threads a whole run onto ONE mouth.
 *   2. "five stopwatch challenge chips render as a 3-then-2 lattice and four
 *      of the five have NO connector to anything". The cause was a
 *      flow-wrapped checkpoint block with no trail anchor. The checkpoint is
 *      spine rows now, so the same connectivity proof that covers the spine
 *      covers it.
 *   3. the enrichment overflow a short column cannot draw off the road must
 *      still SAY it is enrichment, or the dim has been silently dropped.
 *
 * pathwayState.test.ts encodes the unlock model and stays untouched, per the
 * brief.
 *
 * WALL CLOCKS: none. Every input is a literal or pure geometry, so this suite
 * measures the same at 09:00 and at 23:00 (see
 * measurements/gauntlet-economy/LOG.md, "The instruments that only worked
 * before dark").
