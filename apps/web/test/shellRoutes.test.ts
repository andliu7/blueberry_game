/**
 * The tab shell's contract, as checks rather than as a paragraph in a comment.
 *
 * Two claims are made by the owner amendment of 2026-08-28 and both of them are
 * the kind that rot quietly. A tab count rots the first time somebody adds one
 * to the array and nothing complains. "Every route still resolves so a deep
 * link does not 404" rots the first time an id is dropped from the union and a
 * hash in a student's history starts landing on the pathway with no sign that
 * it was ever anything else.
 *
 * mobile-ui's number is the one asserted here: five is the HARD limit. The
 * assertion is written at five because five is a rule where a smaller count is
 * a judgement, and a check should fail on the rule. The count today is asserted
 * separately, so a change to it is a deliberate edit to this file rather than a
 * silent slide.
 *
 * THE COUNT WENT FROM FOUR TO FIVE ON 2026-09-05, and that edit is exactly the
 * deliberate one this file was shaped to force. Feed joins the bar between
 * Cards and Me per the owner's amendment at the calibration gate of
 * 2026-09-01, quoted in CLAUDE.md's tab section and in docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md
 * under "Header and tabs", and drawn in every committed frame in
 * docs/reference/design-goals/units/. The bar now sits ON mobile-ui's ceiling,
 * which is why the rule assertion below matters more than it did at four: a
 * sixth tab cannot be added without one leaving, and this is the check that
 * says so.

/**
 * The pathway's mechanism nodes used to link as "?reaction=x#/trainer". A
 * query string BEFORE the hash is part of the document URL, so following one
 * is a full navigation: measured on the pathway as one mainFrame navigation, a
 * window sentinel lost, and about two seconds of the front-door loader
 * replaying where the mechanism should be. Every "?hunt=" and "?sequence="
 * node on the map did it, which is every mechanism in the product.
 *
 * The fix is to carry the parameter inside the hash. This reads the source
 * rather than calling hrefForPlayable, which is module-private to PathwayTab
 * and would need that whole component imported into a DOM-less suite to reach.
 * Coarse in the safe direction: it looks for the exact shape of the defect, a
 * template literal whose query sits ahead of its hash.
