/**
 * ONE MOTIF, ONE FILE. The ball-and-stick mark rides the node sheet's header
 * and the guidebook's badge pill, and it is the same component in both.
 *
 * THE MOTIF IS A TWO-CENTRE SKELETON, NOT A STAR. Re-traced from the goal
 * images after the attempt 2 critic found the built mark was a different
 * object: a symmetric four-around-one X. Measured off
 * blueberry_r5-node-sheet-v2 (dark-pixel bbox x 140..184, y 685..719, so 45
 * by 35 image px, which is 32.5 by 25.3 css px at the render's 1.385 scale)
 * and confirmed on blueberry_r5-guidebook at 298..345 x 290..332:
 *
 *   a MAUVE centre at (16.5, 21) bonded to a SLATE-BLUE centre at (31, 19.5)
 *   the mauve carries two satellites, up-left and down-left
 *   the slate carries two satellites, up-right and down-right
 *
 * So it is asymmetric, it is wider than it is tall, and it reads as a small
 * molecule rather than as a decorative star. The viewBox is 45 by 35, the
 * bbox's own aspect, because squaring it would have redrawn the geometry.
 *
 * THE PALETTE IS MUTED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The sampled fills are a mauve
 * (181,156,178), a slate blue (175,182,201), a tan (232,214,190), a pale
 * cream (252,237,208), a warm grey (219,211,190) and a peach (222,193,161),
 * with a THIN warm-BROWN rim whose darkest pixel is (109,91,81), lighter than
 * the title ink beside it. The mark sits quietly next to the title; it is not
 * the loudest object on the sheet. The build it replaces filled saturated
 * cyan (--diamond) and orange-red (--streak), which spent the HUD's gem and
 * streak semantics on decoration inside a lesson mark.
 *
 * THE RIM IS BROWN, NOT SLATE, and both it and the bonds are hairlines. The
 * round 2 critic put the mark beside the picture and found the same geometry
 * reading as a hard UI icon rather than the reference's soft sticker mark:
 * the rim expression mixed toward --foreground and landed on a cool
 * (97,94,105), and the strokes were half again as heavy as the reference's.
 * The colour is fixed in pathway-sheet.css (--ns-atom-warm feeds both the rim
 * and the bond); the weights are fixed here.
 *
 * Every fill arrives as a derived token from pathway-sheet.css (.ns-molecule),
 * so a palette move carries the mark and the dark theme is a measured pair
 * rather than an inversion. Every atom keeps a rim, so the contrast audit's
 * "a shape is one component" rule resolves each one on its boundary and the
 * pale cream atom reads as a pale sphere rather than as a hole; that is how
 * the reference draws it too.
 *
 * The goal green is deliberately absent: DESIGN-GOALS makes light green the
 * PROGRESS semantic, and a decorative atom reports no progress.
 *
 * Traced SVG, per DESIGN-GOALS: icons are never raster and never emoji.
