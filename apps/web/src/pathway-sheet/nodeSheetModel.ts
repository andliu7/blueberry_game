/**
 * The node sheet's model: everything the sheet SAYS, derived once, with no DOM.
 *
 * WHY A MODEL FILE. The house rule (vitest.config.ts) is that React components
 * are judged by the human gate and the blind critic, while the decisions that
 * can be wrong in a testable way live in pure functions. Which card is
 * pressable, what the disabled copy says, and how many pips are filled are all
 * decisions of that kind, so they are derived here and the component only
 * draws the result. The correspondence is chargeGateModel.ts one door earlier:
 * that sheet prices the entry, this one describes the room.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SHEET IS, per docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md "The node sheet and the
 * guidebook": tap a node, a bottom sheet rises with a Practice card
 * (difficulty pips, violet 3D START), a Challenge card (stopwatch, double
 * dagger), and a hamburger in the corner that opens the guidebook. There is
 * deliberately no separate Concept row; the guidebook is the concept surface.
 *
 * PROGRESS IS SERVER STATE. The caller hands in a state already derived by
 * pathwayState.ts from the journal; this file never decides whether a node is
 * unlocked, it only words what the given state means. Same discipline as the
 * rest of the client: render the unlock, never rule on it.
