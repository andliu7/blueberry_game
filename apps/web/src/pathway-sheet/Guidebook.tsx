/**
 * The guidebook page: the concept surface behind the node sheet's hamburger.
 *
 * Reference: blueberry_r5-guidebook_1788286119.png. The format is locked by
 * docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md: a text-and-image explainer, a key-idea callout card,
 * and a numbered worked-example strip; body text in the neutral content face
 * (no .title-face on anything a student reads as content). The draft text in
 * the reference image is model gibberish; the layout is what binds.
 *
 * THE COPY IS PLACEHOLDER, and the page says so. Every GuidebookContent this
 * phase can produce carries placeholder:true (see guidebookContent.ts), and a
 * placeholder page renders the gate-mark pill so a draft can never pass as a
 * reviewed lesson. When authored copy lands after the human gate, the flag
 * flips in data and the pill leaves with it; nothing here changes.
 *
 * The figures are deliberately abstract line art (a ring, an arrow, shapes),
 * not a drawn mechanism: a specific mechanism drawing in a generic component
 * would be wrong chemistry on most of the 192 nodes it renders for.

 * (blueberry_artkit-prop-sheet: terrace edge tiles, outlined erlenmeyers with
 * a liquid level, flourishes).
 *
 * THE REFERENCE DRAWS LAYERED TERRACE STEPS, NOT A DOME. Attempt 2 shipped
 * one 272 by 160 semicircle right-anchored behind the callout and a second
 * far below, and the critic named it: the picture has a broad LOW shoulder
 * whose crest runs from behind the figure card off the right edge, a second
 * lower step behind the callout, a third rising from the left further down,
 * and a thin curled antenna standing on the first crest.
 *
 * EACH PROP IS ANCHORED TO THE SECTION IT SITS BEHIND, not to an offset down
 * the page. That is the fix for the placement bug rather than a new number: a
 * title that wraps to two lines, or a draft pill that comes and goes, moves
 * every absolute offset below it, and an anchored prop moves with the thing
 * it belongs to.
 *
 * The mechanics, named because they are the non-obvious part: the prop is
 * absolutely positioned inside its section with z-index -1, and the section
 * is a stacking context, so the prop paints under that section's own content
 * and above the page behind it without needing a rule on any sibling.
