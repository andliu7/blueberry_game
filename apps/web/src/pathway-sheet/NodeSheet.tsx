/**
 * The node sheet: what a tapped pathway node offers, before anything starts.
 *
 * Reference: blueberry_r5-node-sheet-v2_1788286114.png, and this round is a
 * VISUAL FIDELITY round, so the picture is the spec down to the geometry.
 * Every measurement is written out in pathway-sheet.css's header with the
 * image coordinates it was taken from. The composition, top to bottom:
 * grabber, a ONE ROW head (molecule mark, title, hamburger), a full width
 * Practice card holding exactly two rows (heading plus difficulty pips, then
 * the violet 3D START), a HALF WIDTH Challenge card in the SAME cream with
 * the SAME near-black heading, holding its heading and then the stopwatch and
 * double dagger on a second left aligned row, and the berry rising centred
 * over the sheet's own bottom edge into the tab bar.
 *
 * THE 3D CHIPS ARE EDGE AND FACE LAYERS, per
 * docs/reference/design-goals/BUTTON-MECHANICS.md, which DESIGN-GOALS says to
 * read before building any pressable: the well is the darker edge and never
 * moves, the face sits on it and is the only thing that translates, so the
 * chip's painted footprint does not change on press. See pathway-sheet.css's
 * chip section, and .path-node in tabs/pathway/pathway.css for the same
 * pattern this reuses rather than reinvents.
 *
 * Per docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md there is no separate Concept row; the guidebook
 * behind the hamburger is the concept surface.
 *
 * WHY A NATIVE <dialog>. Modality, focus trapping, Escape and the top layer
 * are the browser's; hand rolling those is three bugs. Same call and the same
 * reasoning as ChargeGate.tsx, LanguagePicker.tsx and Hud.tsx. The dialog is
 * given a real box that ENDS at the tab bar rather than filling the viewport,
 * because the reference keeps the four tabs visible and undimmed under the
 * sheet; it is still modal, so the bar is visible without being reachable.
 *
 * WHO HOLDS THE NODE. The caller. The sheet renders whatever SheetNode it is
 * handed and owns no pathway knowledge, exactly as the Charge sheet owns no
 * pathway knowledge: which node was tapped is the track's business. START and
 * Challenge only call back; anything that costs charge stays behind the
 * Charge sheet the integrator opens next, so this component touches no
 * economy state at all.
 *
 * THE PRESS IS ACKNOWLEDGED ON POINTER DOWN. Callbacks fire on onPointerDown,
 * with onClick as the keyboard path (Enter and Space produce no pointer
 * event), and preventDefault so a wrapping form or anchor cannot race it.
 * A pointer activation is followed by a click for the same gesture, so
 * callbacks must be idempotent per activation; the pathway's enterHandlers
 * set the same contract and setState-shaped callers meet it for free.

 * The head is ONE ROW in the reference and it has to stay one row for every
 * node, not only for a one-word name (see .ns-head in pathway-sheet.css). The
 * title truncates rather than wraps, so the only lever left is size, and the
 * map's node titles have a median length of 21 characters with a tail out to
 * 44. On a 390 px phone the title's column is about 262 px, which holds about
 * 18 characters at the reference's 22 px and about 26 at 18 px. So a name over
 * this length takes the smaller step, most names arrive whole, and the
 * picture's own 22 px is what a short name still gets.
