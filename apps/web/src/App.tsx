/**
 * The root. Reads the hash route once, and either runs onboarding or renders
 * the shell around the current tab.
 *
 * Onboarding is lazy for the same reason the tabs are: a returning student
 * never downloads it. A first visit with no stored progress is redirected into
 * it; skipping is always available inside and leads to the trainer, not to a
 * wall, per BUILD-PROMPT.md Phase 5.
 *
 * The URL flags the Phase 4 measurement scripts rely on (?auto=1, ?stats=1,
 * ?renderer=3d) are read by the trainer tab, which is where the canvas lives,
 * so `measure:headless` and `measure:device` keep working against the default
 * route.
