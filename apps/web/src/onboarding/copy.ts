/**
 * Every student facing sentence in onboarding, in one file, and every one of
 * them is a DRAFT.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md, loop discipline: "Phase 5 carries the onboarding funnel and the
 * free lessons, which are the highest leverage copy in the product. That makes
 * it a human gate, not a loop. There is no exit condition for 'this lesson
 * converts.'" So the flow and the frames are the deliverable here and the words
 * are the owner's. Each string carries HUMAN_GATE_MARK so a reader can see at a
 * glance which sentences are still waiting on that gate, and so a test can
 * assert none of them slipped out unmarked.
 *
 * The mark is a PREFIX rather than a suffix on purpose: a truncated line in a
 * narrow chip still shows it.
 *
 * WHY THE STRINGS LIVE APART FROM THE COMPONENTS. Two reasons and they agree.
 * The owner rewrites this file at the gate without opening a single .tsx, and
 * the test that checks the voice contract reads one module rather than walking
 * JSX. The ids are stable; only the words move.
 *
 * ONE SHORT QUESTION PER SCREEN, owner 2026-09-04, in docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md:
 * "the onboarding questions are too complex. One short question per screen,
 * plain words, no compound sentences, no chemistry vocabulary in the framing.
 * The placement quiz is the only place a real chemistry question appears."
 *
 * The drafts below were rewritten to that ruling and it is not left to the
 * gate to notice a regression: FRAMING_LINES at the foot of this file is the
 * set of lines the ruling governs, and onboardingFlow.test.ts holds each one
 * to a single sentence, a length ceiling and a jargon list. The lines it does
 * NOT govern are named there too, with the reason for each.
 *
 * VOICE, per CLAUDE.md: a coach on the student's side. Name what happens
 * plainly, treat every answer as a normal answer, make the next action feel
 * within reach. No scolding, no rhetorical questions, no faux patience. These
 * drafts are written to that contract so the gate is reviewing the words and
 * not the tone from scratch.
