/**
 * The onboarding flow model. Pure: no React, no DOM, no clock.
 *
 * The step list is the seven-step capture mapping from the Beats and Decks
 * record (docs/reference/competitors/duolingo-live/2026-08-27-run2, p05-p19):
 * two welcome beats, how-did-you-hear, learning reason, proficiency (our
 * placement quiz), course overview, daily goal, choose path. Steps live in
 * the hash (#/start/<step>) so the browser back button steps back, which the
 * file this replaced already did and which is kept deliberately.
 *
 * No wall clock is read anywhere in this module. Elapsed seconds reach the
 * quiz machine as event data measured by the shell with performance.now(),
 * the same discipline the machine itself documents, so every function here
 * gives the same answer at 9am and at 11pm.
