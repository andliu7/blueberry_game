/**
 * The onboarding icon set: flat colour STICKERS, drawn as SVG.
 *
 * DESIGN-GOALS, owner finding 2026-09-02: "ICONS ARE SVG, NEVER RASTER, NEVER
 * EMOJI. Every in-product icon is a traced SVG that inherits currentColor."
 * That clause is about the FORMAT and it is honoured here: every mark below is
 * a path on a 24 unit grid and every OUTLINE is `currentColor`, so a glyph
 * follows the ink of whatever chip holds it and both themes work.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED THIS ROUND, and it was the single most visible difference
 * between the built screen and blueberry_r9-onboard-question. The image draws
 * each chip icon as a full colour sticker: a purple erlenmeyer with a face, a
 * grey stethoscope, a red and white life ring, a black four point sparkle. The
 * previous pass drew monochrome line glyphs in the muted ink and recorded the
 * divergence as deliberate, on the reasoning that a coloured illustration
 * cannot take the picked state's colour with it. That reasoning was answered
 * by looking at the image again: the picked chip in the goal image keeps its
 * flask PURPLE and carries the pick in the outline, the edge and the check.
 * The icon was never what said "picked".
 *
 * So these are flat fills with a real outline, which is the sticker language
 * (docs/DESIGN-TOKENS.md and the sticker audit: flat fills, outlined shapes,
 * no gradient, no blur). EVERY FILLED SHAPE CARRIES AN OUTLINE, and that is a
 * measurement decision as well as a drawing one: contrast-audit.mjs collapses
 * a shape's fill and stroke to the better of the two, so a near white life
 * ring reads against the cream chip through its outline rather than needing to
 * be darkened into something that is no longer white.
 *
 * COLOUR COMES FROM TOKENS, never from a literal. The palette here is
 * --primary-bright for the violet props, --destructive for the red ones,
 * --muted-foreground for the grey ones, --foreground for the black ones, and
 * --ob-prop for the white ones, which onboarding.css derives from --card and
 * --primary-foreground so a white prop is still white at night.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` on all of them: the chip's own label is the accessible name,
 * and an icon that repeats it is one more thing a screen reader has to say.

/**
 * THE WELCOME BEAT'S BACKGROUND WORLD: two overlapping white mounds filling

 *
 * REDRAWN AGAINST blueberry_r9-onboard-welcome AFTER A PIXEL COMPARISON, and
 * every number below is that comparison rather than a taste. The previous pass
 * drew a thin arc entering only from the RIGHT at 82 percent of screen height,
 * with no mass at all on the left half and the white fill almost entirely
 * below GET STARTED, so the composition the backdrop rework was written to
 * deliver never reached the screen. The image draws an opaque mound whose
 * crest is at 67 percent of screen height, unbroken across BOTH edges, with a
 * second overlapping mound in front of it, and the button resting on it.
 *
 * WHERE 67 PERCENT LANDS IN THIS viewBox, since it is the one piece of
 * arithmetic here. `.ob-welcome__horizon` is 116 percent of a 390px frame at
 * this viewBox's own ratio, so it renders 394 css tall against a 844 css
 * screen and is anchored to the bottom. 67 percent of 844 from the top is 278
 * css up from the bottom, which is y = 100 in these units. That is where the
 * main crest sits and it is why the flask's base is at y = 104.
 *
 * THE FLASK IS AN ERLENMEYER AND THE LAST ONE WAS NOT. The image draws a wide
 * triangular body on a flat base with a short lipped neck, about 61 by 74 css,
 * fully visible and standing ON the rise. The previous pass drew a tall
 * near-parallel-sided tube with a long neck and a barely flared foot, half
 * hidden behind GET STARTED, which read as a chimney. Different silhouette,
 * not a smaller version of the same one.
 *
 * EVERY EDGE IS `--ob-prop-edge`, which onboarding.css now resolves to the
 * warm tan the image ghosts these props in rather than the cool neutral grey
 * that made wallpaper read as foreground objects. See the token's comment
 * there for the measured luminance delta and the argument about what
 * decoration owes.
