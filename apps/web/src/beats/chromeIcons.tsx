/**
 * The lesson chrome's icons, traced rather than typed.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. DESIGN-GOALS, "ICONS ARE SVG, NEVER RASTER, NEVER
 * EMOJI": "Every in-product icon is a traced SVG that inherits currentColor
 * (emoji vary per platform and are banned from product chrome; PNGs cannot
 * theme or scale)". The lesson chrome was breaking that with glyph-set
 * characters: the exit rendered the literal U+2715 MULTIPLICATION X and the
 * report control the literal U+2691 BLACK FLAG. Both vary in weight, width
 * and vertical centring from one platform's font to the next, which is the
 * exact failure the rule names, and the committed frames draw each of them
 * as a drawn mark.
 *
 * Every icon below is a stroked path on a 24 unit grid with no fill and no
 * colour of its own, so it takes the ink of whatever chrome it sits in and
 * scales with it. The gem is the one filled shape, because
 * blueberry_r9-lesson-reaction draws its currency counter as a solid cut
 * gem rather than as an outline.
