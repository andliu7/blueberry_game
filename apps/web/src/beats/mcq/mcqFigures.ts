/**
 * THE DRAWN CHEMISTRY ON AN MCQ BEAT.
 *
 * Owner ruling 1 of 2026-09-04, in docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md: "EVERY QUESTION
 * CARRIES A VISUAL. A structure, a spectrum, a scheme, a mechanism frame ...
 * a question that is only prose has already lost the student. A beat that
 * cannot show something is a beat that needs authoring, not a beat that ships
 * as text."
 *
 * `content.ts` carried the opposite rule in its own header, written before
 * that ruling existed: "NO moleculeId ON ANY BEAT IN THIS FILE, on purpose ...
 * the renderer is another agent's surface". The renderer is no longer another
 * surface. `onboarding/StructureFigure.tsx` draws a `Figure`, `lesson/
 * lessonFigures.ts` already authors reaction schemes with it for the
 * curriculum player, and this file does the same job for the beat runner. The
 * content file's rule is superseded by the ruling, and its comment is updated
 * rather than left to contradict this.
 *
 * WHY THE TABLE IS HERE AND NOT ON THE BEAT. `McqBeat` has a `moleculeId`
 * field and no figure field, and widening the beat union is a change that
 * ripples through grading, the card generator and the authoring validator for
 * a rendering concern. Keying a side table on the beat's own id costs one
 * lookup and keeps every one of those files unchanged. It is the same shim
 * shape `lessonFigures.ts` and `onboarding/figures.ts` already are, for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS THIS FROM BEING INVENTED CHEMISTRY. Every entry is authored
 * against one exact beat id, never derived from a prompt's words at run time,
 * so a reworded question keeps its drawing and a REPLACED question breaks the
 * key rather than silently redrawing the old molecule under new words.
 * `test/mcqFigures.test.ts` walks the real beat list and fails when a beat has
 * no visual, so a newly authored question fails a test rather than reaching a
 * student as a wall of text.
 *
 * THREE VISUAL SHAPES, because an MCQ is not always a reaction:
 *
 *   scheme     a transformation. The question is downstream of it
 *   structure  one molecule the question is ABOUT
 *   pair       two molecules the question COMPARES
 *
 * The pair shape is the one worth defending. "Compare phenol with
 * cyclohexanol" is a question whose whole content is a comparison, and a
 * comparison drawn as one molecule teaches half of it. Two captioned species
 * side by side is the same composition the scheme card uses with the arrow
 * taken out.
 *
 * A SCHEME HERE MAY STATE BOTH SIDES, which is the one place this file's
 * invariants differ from `lessonFigures.ts`. There a fully stated scheme
 * would be a diagram with no question in it, because there the scheme IS the
 * question. Here the question is downstream: "reduce the nitro group, then
 * pick what the RING becomes" needs both sides drawn, because the thing being
 * asked about is neither of them. What this file forbids instead is a scheme
 * that states nothing, and the test holds that.
 *
 * NO WALL CLOCK, no state, no React, no DOM. Pure data and pure functions, so
 * the node suite can walk all of it.
