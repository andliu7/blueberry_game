/**
 * A whole run of easy MCQ beats for one pathway node, as one mountable screen.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A review found that nothing in the app rendered this
 * beat: fourteen authored questions and a component, reachable from nowhere, so
 * no claim about how it feels had ever been tested against a screen. The cause
 * was a seam problem rather than a missing route. McqBeatView is one question
 * and knows nothing about the run around it, so an integrator had to write the
 * session wiring themselves before they could mount anything. This file is that
 * wiring, written once and tested, so hanging the beat off a route is one
 * import and one element.
 *
 * WHAT IT OWNS, and it is deliberately only three things: the session value
 * from session.ts, the real clock, and a stopwatch for the question on screen.
 * Everything else is a call into a pure function next door. That split is the
 * same one lesson/LessonPlayer.tsx uses and it is what makes the run testable
 * without a DOM: session.ts has the rules, this has the useState.
 *
 * THE NON OBVIOUS REACT PATTERN, named because the author asked for that. The
 * `if (seenRun !== runKey)` block below is React's documented "adjust state
 * when a prop changes" pattern. Setting state during render makes React throw
 * the render away and start again with the new state before anything reaches
 * the screen, which is how a parent that swaps `node` without giving this
 * component a `key` still gets a fresh run rather than the previous node's
 * answers under the new question. `useRef` is the other one: `startedAt` is a
 * mutable box that survives renders and, unlike state, changing it does not
 * cause one, which is exactly what a stopwatch wants.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN. It does not save a card, it does not write progress and
 * it does not send a report. Each of those leaves as a callback, because the
 * deck store, the progress source and Phase 6's reporting endpoint are other
 * people's files and a beat that reached into them would be three integrations
 * instead of none.
