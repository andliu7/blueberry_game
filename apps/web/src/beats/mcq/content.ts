/**
 * The easy multiple choice beats. Authored data, and nothing else lives here.
 *
 * WHY THIS BEAT EXISTS AND WHY IT IS DELIBERATELY EASY. Owner complaint,
 * recorded against the onboarding questions and the DAT section quiz: they are
 * too complex, and nobody comes back to a question that costs three minutes to
 * read. So this beat has a hard authoring contract, checked by
 * mcqAuthoringViolations in authoring.ts and asserted by a test: one concept
 * per question, three or four options, every option short enough to read in a
 * glance, no arithmetic, no "first do this then do that". Hard questions still
 * exist in the product. They live in the quizzes at gates and bosses, and they
 * are not this file.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTENT IS WHAT IT IS. These four topics are the ones the task
 * names, and they are four of the seventeen spine nodes that are not arrow
 * pushing: directing effects (u3-directing), kinetic against thermodynamic
 * control (u1-kvt and u9-kvt-enolate), nitro reduction (u3-nitro-red and
 * u10-nitro-red) and phenol acidity (u11-acidity). Every node id here is a real
 * id out of demo/pathwayMap.ts and every conceptId is a real one out of
 * packages/curriculum's CONCEPTS; both are asserted by tests rather than
 * trusted, because a beat pointing at a node that does not exist is a beat
 * nothing ever plays.
 *
 * The wrong options are not invented. They are the mistake patterns already
 * mined out of the owner's own CHEM 241 exams and written down in
 * docs/COURSE-OUTLINE-ORGO2.md: "inductive and resonance effects conflated",
 * "kinetic and thermodynamic mapped to the wrong product", "kinetic and
 * thermodynamic enolate confused", and the instructor's own phenol rubric,
 * which is that meta cannot reach the phenoxide oxygen by resonance and only
 * reaches it by induction. That is what makes each `why` a Tier 2 explanation
 * in CLAUDE.md's sense rather than a restatement of the marking.
 *
 * EVERY OPTION CARRIES A `why`, INCLUDING THE RIGHT ONE. Two reasons. The
 * wrong ones need it because packages/curriculum's own cause registry says so:
 * `option_is_not_the_correct_one` is specificity `generic` and its teaching
 * note reads "on a multiple choice problem this cause means a distractor is
 * missing". An MCQ where every wrong option is explained can never fall
 * through to that cause, and there is a test that says so. The right one needs
 * it because CLAUDE.md's feedback section is explicit that a correct step
 * explains itself too, since a student who guesses correctly has learned
 * nothing.
 *
 * OPTION ORDER IS FIXED, AND NOT SHUFFLED AT RUNTIME. A shuffle is the obvious
 * answer to positional bias and it costs more than it looks: a random order
 * means the screen a student saw is not the screen a bug report describes, and
 * it means a card generated from a mistake names an option that has moved. The
 * cheaper fix is authoring discipline, so the correct option's index is varied
 * across the set here and a test caps how often any one index is the answer.
 *
 * NO `moleculeId` ON ANY BEAT IN THIS FILE, on purpose. A question that needs
 * a drawn structure beside it is a question that needs the renderer, and the
 * renderer is another agent's surface. Every question here is answerable from
 * its own words, which is also what "one concept, no multi step reasoning"
 * means in practice.
