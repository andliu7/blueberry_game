/**
 * The easy MCQ beat on screen, in the shape of the reference captures: a top
 * bar, a scrolling sheet, and one full width button pinned at the bottom that
 * never moves.
 *
 * WHY THIS COMPONENT HOLDS NO STATE AT ALL. It used to hold its own answer and
 * grade on the first tap, and a harsh review found what that costs: a scroll
 * fling mis-tap was an irreversible wrong answer with a mistake card toast
 * behind it. The pick / commit split that fixes it lives in session.ts, where a
 * test can hold it, because the web suite runs in a node environment with no
 * DOM and any rule that lives in JSX is a rule nothing can test. So this file
 * is a controlled component: every value it renders arrives as a prop and every
 * gesture leaves as a callback. If you are debugging a wrong verdict at 1am, it
 * is not in this file. McqRunner.tsx is the piece that owns the session.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THE REFERENCE CAPTURES SHOW AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT MISSED.
 *
 *   1. PICK, THEN PRESS. "fill in the blank.png" and the how_to capture both
 *      put a full width CHECK under the options, and in the how_to capture it
 *      is visibly inactive because nothing is picked yet. A tap selects; the
 *      button commits. Selecting is free and changeable.
 *
 *   2. THE BUTTON DOES NOT MOVE. "short explanation.png" puts CONTINUE in the
 *      same full bleed slot at the bottom of the sheet that CHECK occupied,
 *      after an explanation that can be several lines. Here that is a sticky
 *      action bar rather than the last child of a growing column, so the way
 *      forward is in the same place before and after the answer. `pb-safe` is
 *      theme.css's safe area inset, so it clears the home indicator too.
 *
 *   3. THE TOP BAR CARRIES AN EXIT, ONE BAR AND ONE COUNT, and nothing
 *      else. This used to say "an exit and a flag", after an older Duolingo
 *      capture. The committed lesson frames
 *      (blueberry_r9-lesson-mechanism, blueberry_r9-lesson-reaction) are the
 *      newer and more specific reference for this exact row and they draw
 *      three things: the violet exit chip, one long progress capsule, and a
 *      currency count paired with a DRAWN ICON. No flag, and no level chip.
 *      The flag is not cut, because a student who meets a confusing authored
 *      beat still needs a way to say so; it moves to the foot of the
 *      question, where it says what it does in words.
 *
 * NO RED ON THIS SCREEN, the rule lesson/Feedback.tsx already set: the student
 * is learning, not being marked down. The answer is marked with the `--good`
 * family and the option they committed keeps its periwinkle stroke, so they
 * can still see what they chose beside what was right.
 *
 * SELECTION IS SAID WITH FORM, NEVER WITH A WORD. blueberry_r9-lesson-reaction
 * marks the picked candidate by keeping the cream fill and adding an indigo
 * stroke and a visible bottom lip: the card lifts, the way every other control
 * in this product lifts. An earlier build tinted it with a violet wash and
 * then wrote the literal word "picked" down the right hand side, which is a
 * control captioning a state it failed to draw. The four looks live in one
 * `data-state` vocabulary shared with the picture tiles; see optionState below
 * and beat-chrome.css for the drawing.
 *
 * CONTRAST. The options that were neither the answer nor the pick are pushed
 * back by SURFACE and nothing else. They used to carry `opacity-70` on top of
 * `text-muted-foreground`, which blends to 3.59:1 in light and 4.05:1 in dark,
 * both under the 4.5:1 body floor the Budgets table fixes. De-emphasis comes
 * from the surface, never from thinning the ink.
 *
 * KEYBOARD. The options stay focusable after the answer, marked `aria-disabled`
 * with the handler returning early, rather than `disabled`. A disabled element
 * leaves the tab order, and the element the student just activated leaving the
 * tab order dumps focus to the document and makes them Tab the whole page to
 * reach Continue. That is the same reason focus moves to the explanation when
 * it appears: it is one Tab from there to the button, and a screen reader hears
 * the explanation rather than a silent jump.
 *
 * THE QUESTION IS A PICTURE FIRST, owner ruling 1 of 2026-09-04: "a question
 * that is only prose has already lost the student", and it names every beat
 * type. So the stem is followed by a drawn visual, from `mcqFigures.ts`: the
 * scheme for a transformation, the molecule for a question about one, the two
 * molecules for a question that compares. The earlier note here said a
 * question needing a drawn structure needed a renderer that was another
 * surface's; the renderer is `onboarding/StructureFigure` and it is in this
 * app, so the note was a gap rather than a boundary. `moleculeId` on a McqBeat
 * is still ignored: the visual is keyed on the beat id, which is what lets an
 * MCQ draw a scheme or a pair rather than only a single molecule.
 *
 * AND THE ANSWERS ARE PICTURES TOO, WHERE THEY CAN BE. Owner ruling 2 of the
 * same day: "OPTION CARDS ARE PICTURES WITH CAPTIONS, not captions with
 * pictures". A beat whose options are positions or structures renders as the
 * committed frame's 2 by 2 tile grid, drawn from the option-figure table in
 * `mcqFigures.ts`; a beat whose options are RULES keeps the word rows, because
 * a rule is not a molecule and the reference frame draws its own rule answers
 * as words as well. The table decides which, all or nothing per beat, and this
 * file only asks it.

            a short name. So a beat whose options are POSITIONS or STRUCTURES
            gets that grid, from the option-figure table in mcqFigures.ts. A
            beat whose options are RULES ("activating and meta directing") gets
