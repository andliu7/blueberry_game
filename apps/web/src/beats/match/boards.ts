/**
 * Four authored boards, one per content target in this piece's brief: reagent
 * to job, pKa to compound, spectroscopic signal to functional group, and
 * protecting group to what it protects.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTENT LIVES BESIDE THE BEAT rather than in demo/. Every board here
 * belongs to a real pathway node that is one of the 17 spine nodes the trainer
 * cannot play, and the node ids are the ones already in demo/pathwayMap.ts:
 * u5-syn-diol, u9-pka, u6-ir and u5-protecting. Putting the boards in the
 * package that renders them keeps the beat self contained while the shape is
 * still settling; moving them into the authored corpus later is a file move and
 * an id that does not change, per the BeatId invariant in ../types.ts.
 *
 * TWO OF THESE ALREADY EXIST IN packages/curriculum AND ARE NOT DUPLICATED
 * HERE. `org2-match-oxidation-ladder` and `org2-match-acyl-synthesis-jobs` are
 * authored corpus problems with their own distractors, and they are the reagent
 * to job boards for the oxidation ladder and the acyl ladder. These four cover
 * ground those two do not, so a board is authored once and in one place.
 *
 * A CONFLICT WORTH REPORTING RATHER THAN HIDING, and it is about the pKa board.
 * CLAUDE.md makes pKa values professor adjustable: packages/curriculum/src/pka.ts
 * holds the table with sources and a settings layer sits over it with presets
 * and per value overrides. `SortItem` in ../types.ts carries a `pkaSiteId` for
 * exactly that reason. `MatchPair` does not, so a number written into a match
 * target is authored text and no settings layer can reach it. Two things follow
 * and both are deliberate. The right hand cards say "about 5" and "about 13"
 * rather than 4.76 and 13.3, because presets differ by tenths and a band that
 * wide stays true under every table anyone would configure. And the missing
 * field is reported as an integration edit rather than added here, because
 * ../types.ts is not this piece's file to change.
 *
 * A CARD IS A PILL, NOT A PARAGRAPH, and this is the fix that came out of the
 * first review. The reference capture is a phone screenshot, and every pill on
 * it is two or three words, which is why the whole board reads at a glance and
 * a student never scrolls to find a card's partner. The first version of these
 * boards wrote up to seventy characters on a card; in a 390 point viewport that
 * is two columns of roughly 150 points each, so a card wrapped to five or six
 * lines, the two columns lost every row correspondence, and the sentence that
 * is the entire point of this beat sat below the fold. So the rule now, and
 * `CARD_TEXT_CAP` in ./spec.ts reports on it: the CARD carries the claim in as
 * few words as the chemistry allows, and the EXPLANATION lives in `why`, where
 * there is room for it and where the student reads it at the moment it lands.
 * Nothing was made vaguer to fit. Everything cut off a card is still said, one
 * tap later, in a fuller sentence than it had before.
 *
 * Chemistry is stated as it is taught in CHEM 241 and nowhere is a claim made
 * softer to make a card fit. Where a number is approximate the card says about.
