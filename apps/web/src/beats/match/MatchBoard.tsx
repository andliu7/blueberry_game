/**
 * The matching beat on screen: two columns of cards, and the student pairs
 * them. Read the header of ./board.ts first; this file is the view over that
 * state machine and owns no rules.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES THAT THE REFERENCE DOES NOT, because the owner's note on
 * "reference images/matching - not ideal but okay.png" is that this is the one
 * piece to improve on rather than copy. The reference draws four connectors
 * between two scattered columns and grades them on a Continue press. Three
 * things follow from that and all three are fixed here:
 *
 *   A wrong pair gets a reason. ./reasons.ts assembles one per pair, authored
 *   copy first, and it names both cards. The reference says nothing at all.
 *
 *   A right pair clears. The two cards travel toward each other and leave the
 *   board, so what remains is exactly what is still unsolved and the last pair
 *   is one card facing one card. The reference keeps all eight on screen to the
 *   end, so the board is at its most crowded when the student is most stuck.
 *
 *   There is progress inside the board. A counter and a track move the instant
 *   a pair lands, and the same sentence goes into the live region. The
 *   reference has no state between empty and graded.
 *
 * THE PRESENTATION FIELD, and this is a deliberate divergence worth naming.
 * MatchBeat carries `presentation: "connectors" | "columns"`. This build renders
 * columns for both, because connectors and per pair judgement are in tension:
 * a connector board exists to hold several answers at once and be graded
 * together, which is the thing being fixed. A beat authored as connectors is
 * rendered as columns rather than silently half supported, and the divergence
 * comes out of `matchAuthoringProblems` as a WARNING so it reaches the person
 * who authored the beat instead of only the person reading this comment.
 *
 * THE BOARD IS SIZED FOR A PHONE FIRST, which is the surface the reference is
 * a screenshot of. Two things hold that up and they work as a pair. The cards
 * are pills: ./spec.ts caps their text and ./boards.ts keeps every shipped card
 * inside two lines, so four pairs, the target column, the track and the
 * feedback box share one 390 point screen without a scroll. And the columns
 * stay two columns at every width, because a matching board's whole affordance
 * is that a partner is across from you rather than somewhere below you.
 * Stacking would remove the scroll and remove the game with it. The narrow
 * screen is paid for in padding and in `min-w-0`, not in the layout.
 *
 * FOCUS IS PUT BACK after a pair clears. See `focusTargetAfterSettle` in
 * ./board.ts for why: the two buttons unmount and the browser drops focus to
 * <body>, so without this a keyboard student re-tabs the whole page per pair.
 *
 * REACT PATTERNS USED HERE, each named because this codebase is read by someone
 * who is strong in Python and Java:
 *   useReducer      one state object, one pure transition function. Same shape
 *                   as a Java switch over an enum of events; React just calls it.
 *   useRef          a mutable box that survives re renders WITHOUT causing one.
 *                   Used two ways here. As a plain box it holds the start time
 *                   and the fired-once latches. Handed to a JSX element as
 *                   `ref={...}` React fills it with the real DOM node, which is
 *                   the only way to call focus() on something.
 *   useMemo         cache a derived value between renders. Used for the built
 *                   spec, because building it validates the board and throwing
 *                   twice a second would be silly.
 *   useEffect       run something after the DOM is painted, and clean it up.
 *                   Used only for timers and for telling the caller what
 *                   happened.

 * The board plays, and something about how it is authored is still worth
 * saying. A card over the pill cap, a pairing with no explanation behind it, a
 * beat asking for connectors on a board that judges one pair at a time.

 * It is drawn quietly and above the board rather than hidden behind a flag,
 * because a warning nobody renders is a warning nobody reads, and this is the
 * only surface where the author and the sentence are in the same place.
