/**
 * What a trace beat is drawing, authored once and read three ways.
 *
 * THE ONE AUTHORED THING is a `TraceTarget`: a skeletal graph. Vertices with a
 * position and, where it is not carbon, an element. Edges with a bond order.
 * A stroke order that groups edges into the gestures a hand actually makes.
 * Everything else in this beat is DERIVED from it:
 *
 *   `strokesOf`   the guide strokes the student traces (beats/types.ts shape)
 *   `stateOf`     the chem-core MechanismState that is the answer key at L3
 *   `formulaOf`   the molecular formula, for the prompt and the card back
 *
 * That matters because the alternative is authoring the picture and the answer
 * separately, and then they drift: a bond added to the drawing and forgotten in
 * the key marks a correct structure wrong, and a student loses an evening to
 * our clerical error. One source, three readings, no drift possible.
 *
 * IMPLICIT HYDROGENS ARE COMPUTED, NOT AUTHORED, and this is the only piece of
 * chemistry in this file. A skeletal structure means "carbon here, hydrogens to
 * taste", so an author who had to write `implicitHydrogens: 2` on every vertex
 * would get one wrong eventually. The rule is the standard electron count and
 * it is written out in `fillValence` below with its own worked cases.
 *
 * WHY THE SAME FILLING SERVES BOTH SIDES. recognise.ts builds the student's
 * drawing into a graph of exactly this shape and runs it through exactly this
 * function before grading. So the answer key and the submission are filled by
 * one rule, and a bug in the rule cannot make a correct drawing wrong: it would
 * have to be wrong identically on both sides, which is a draw, not a false
 * negative. The rule is still tested on its own, because "wrong identically"
 * still teaches wrong chemistry.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO. No stereochemistry. packages/curriculum's
 * structure comparison returns UNDECIDED the moment either side declares any,
 * and `createStructureAnswer` refuses to build an answer that carries it, so a
 * trace target with a wedge would fail at authoring time rather than mid
 * attempt. Trace is a constitution exercise: the skeleton, the heteroatoms, the
 * bond orders. Stereochemistry is a different beat.

 * count less its formal charge. Let `shell` be what surrounds a filled atom:
 * two for hydrogen and lithium, eight for everything else. If the atom forms
 * `b` bonds and holds `lp` lone pairs then it owns `b + 2lp = available`
 * electrons and is surrounded by `2b + 2lp` of them. Filling the shell without
 * exceeding it gives `b <= shell - available`, and having enough electrons to
 * pair gives `b <= available`. So `b = min(available, shell - available)`.
 *
 *   carbon        available 4, b = min(4, 4) = 4, lp 0
 *   carbocation   available 3, b = min(3, 5) = 3, lp 0. The sextet, correctly
 *                 NOT forced to an octet, which is the case a naive octet rule
 *                 gets wrong and the case organic chemistry cares most about
 *   carbanion     available 5, b = min(5, 3) = 3, lp 1
 *   nitrogen      available 5, b = 3, lp 1
 *   ammonium N    available 4, b = 4, lp 0
 *   oxygen        available 6, b = 2, lp 2
 *   alkoxide O    available 7, b = 1, lp 3
 *   oxocarbenium  available 5, b = 3, lp 1
 *   bromine       available 7, b = 1, lp 3
 *   hydrogen      available 1, shell 2, b = 1, lp 0
 *
 * HYPERVALENCY IS NOT INFERRED. The shell is capped at eight even for period
 * three, so a drawn sulfur carrying six bonds comes back `overValent` rather
 * than quietly given an expanded octet. That is the honest answer for a
 * recognition pass: an expanded octet is an authored claim about a real
 * molecule, not something to guess from a sketch. Nothing in the Organic
 * Chemistry II corpus this beat serves needs one.
