/**
 * The structure trace beat, as a student plays it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DECIDES, and it is a short list because everything hard lives
 * somewhere else: which canvas the mastery level calls for, what sentence to
 * say about an outcome, and when to offer a card. The corridor is geometry.ts,
 * the recognition is recognise.ts, the grading is packages/curriculum, and the
 * molecules are content.ts.
 *
 * THE LADDER, and it is `traceGuideStyle` in beats/types.ts made visible:
 *
 *   L0  guides on, and a press draws the stroke. `canFail(0)` is false and that
 *       is a contract: a first meeting that can be got wrong is a test
 *   L1  guides on, trace them. The corridor is generous and drawn
 *   L2  endpoints only. The corridor is still there and is no longer shown, so
 *       the hand has to know the line rather than read it
 *   L3  blank canvas, freehand, recognised and graded against the real answer
 *
 * WHY A MISS AT L1 OR L2 DOES NOT END THE BEAT. Leaving the corridor is not a
 * wrong answer, it is a hand that slipped, and stopping a trace to mark it
 * would teach a student to be careful rather than to be right. The miss is
 * NAMED out loud when it happens ("come back to the line" reads differently
 * from "keep going") and it is counted, so the result the runner records is
 * honest about how it went. At L3, where the student produced rather than
 * traced, a wrong structure IS a wrong answer and is graded as one.
 *
 * THE CARD OFFER, per the Anki borrow in CLAUDE.md: a mistake OFFERS a card, it
 * never saves one. This component builds the card and hands it up through
 * `onOfferCard`; the deck store, the toast that shrinks it and the deck icon
 * that bounces belong to the cards surface, which another piece owns. What is
 * here is the offer and the `why` copy that makes the card worth keeping.
 *
 * VOICE. Every string a student reads in this file was written against
 * CLAUDE.md's rule: name what happened plainly, treat the mistake as the normal
 * step it is, make the next action feel reachable. No "you should have", no
 * rhetorical questions, and the praise is specific to what they actually did.
