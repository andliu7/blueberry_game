/**
 * A button that acknowledges the press on pointer down, before anything else.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md makes this a contract rather than a nicety: "Every button has a
 * pressed state that renders on pointer down, not on completion", and pointer
 * down to visible acknowledgement is inside the same under 100 ms budget as
 * everything else. This component exists so that contract is one visible piece
 * of code rather than a habit every surface has to remember.
 *
 * WHY IT IS STATE AND NOT `:active`. `:active` would do the job in CSS, but
 * this piece owns no stylesheet (theme.css and tokens.css belong to the shell)
 * and, more usefully, a reader can see the rule here: `onPointerDown` sets
 * `pressed`, the transform renders from it, and `onClick` runs afterwards. If
 * the click ever grows an await, the acknowledgement has already happened.
 *
 * `useState` in a component this small is the boring choice on purpose. It
 * re-renders one button.
