/**
 * L3: turning a wobble into a structure, and then grading it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not handwriting recognition and it never guesses at a
 * letter. A student at L3 draws BONDS as strokes on a blank canvas and TAPS a
 * vertex to say what element sits there, choosing from a palette of the
 * elements the target actually contains. That is how every structure editor a
 * chemist has ever used works, and it is the boring choice on purpose: an OCR
 * pass that reads a hasty "N" as an "H" would mark a correct answer wrong, and
 * a wrong answer on a correct drawing is the single most expensive thing this
 * product can do to a student the night before an exam.
 *
 * SO THE RECOGNITION IS GRAPH RECOGNITION, in four steps, each of them plain:
 *
 *   1. SIMPLIFY. Each raw stroke goes through Ramer to Douglas to Peucker
 *      (geometry.ts), so a ring drawn as one gesture becomes its corners.
 *   2. CLUSTER. Every segment endpoint from every stroke is snapped into a
 *      vertex if it lands within `snapPx` of one. This is what closes a ring
 *      the student did not quite close, and it is the same forgiveness the
 *      corridor gives at L1 and L2, applied to endpoints instead of paths.
 *   3. LABEL. Element placements snap to the nearest vertex. Unlabelled
 *      vertices are carbon, which is skeletal convention.
 *   4. GRADE. The graph is filled by target.ts's one valence rule, built into a
 *      chem-core MechanismState, and handed to packages/curriculum's
 *      `checkStructure`. We do not write our own comparison: that file already
 *      does constitution over a multiset of species, it already knows what it
 *      cannot do, and it has been through an adversary pass.
 *
 * WHY GRADING GOES THROUGH CURRICULUM AND NOT CHEM-CORE. chem-core grades
 * ARROWS. The four answer shapes in CLAUDE.md put "a structure" in
 * packages/curriculum, graded by canonical structure equivalence, and the
 * structure answer kind is already built and already exported. A trace beat is
 * a structure answer with a different input device.
 *
 * ONE SEAM THAT IS NOT CLOSED, and it is reported rather than papered over.
 * `checkStructure` names causes from `CurriculumCauseId`. `BeatResult.cause` in
 * beats/types.ts is `CauseId | BeatShapeCauseId`, which does not include them.
 * So `toBeatResult` below funnels a curriculum cause into the tail id
 * `no_named_cause_logged` while keeping the real cause and its detail on this
 * module's own richer result, which is what the surface shows the student.
 * Nothing is lost to the reader; what is lost is the TYPED id on the recorded
 * result, and that closes the day `BeatCauseId` widens. The required edit is in
 * this piece's return value. It is a narrow funnel by construction: the guided
 * levels resolve to `trace_incomplete` and `trace_left_the_target`, which are
 * real shape causes, and only the L3 structure comparison reaches it.
