/**
 * One pathway node in, one LESSON out: the node's authored beats played in
 * the seven-slot template order, under the recipe strip, closed by the
 * reward slot.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Five beat surfaces were built in parallel, each
 * behind its own directory and each with its own props: the MCQ runner wants
 * a node id, the match board wants one MatchBeat, the sort view wants a
 * SortContent, the synthesis beat wants one SynthesisGapProblem. That is the
 * right shape for each of them in isolation and the wrong shape for the
 * pathway, which knows one thing only: the id of the node the student
 * tapped. This file is the adapter between those two facts, and it is the
 * only place that knows all of them exist.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WITH THE TEMPLATE (S4 lesson-flow piece). The old runner
 * resolved a node to exactly ONE beat kind and played it, so a node carrying
 * an MCQ and a ladder never showed the ladder. Now template.ts plans every
 * authored beat into the slot ordering (hook, recognise, connect, order,
 * produce, recycle, reward) and this runner plays the plan in sequence, with
 * the recipe strip as the lesson's progress bar and a reward card closing
 * the run. The ordering rule, the run state machine and the strip's segments
 * are pure functions in template.ts, where the suite can hold them; this
 * file owns the useState and the wiring, nothing else. The node-to-ladder
 * table moved there with the plan, and is re-exported below so its readers
 * keep their import path.
 *
 * THE NON-OBVIOUS REACT PATTERN, named per the house rule: the
 * `if (seenNode !== node)` block is React's documented adjust-state-when-a-
 * prop-changes pattern. Setting state during render makes React restart the
 * render with the new state before anything reaches the screen, so a parent
 * that swaps `node` without a key still gets a fresh run rather than the
 * previous node's progress under the new lesson.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not invent content: a node with
 * nothing authored renders the honest empty screen, exactly as before.
 *
 * IT DOES BANK, AND THAT IS A CORRECTION. This header used to say "it does not
 * write progress", and reasoned that a celebration about numbers nobody banked
 * would be a lie with confetti on it. The reasoning was right and the
 * conclusion was backwards. The consequence, measured on 2026-09-05 by
 * finishing #/lesson/u1-kvt at 1 of 1 and diffing localStorage: the stored
 * progress was byte-identical afterwards. No lesson recorded, no diamonds, no
 * streak, the pathway header still reading 0 of 86, the node still open, the
 * trail never turning green. `clearNode` had ZERO callers anywhere in the app
 * while `startNode` was already spending charge to enter, so the Path tab, the
 * product's first destination, took payment and banked nothing.
 *
 * So the fix is not to keep refusing the celebration. It is to make the
 * banking real, which makes the celebration true. The run reports one
 * `node_cleared` when it reaches the reward phase, once, and the reward slot
 * shows the diamonds the store actually returned rather than a number this
 * component made up.
 *
 * WHY THE IMPORT IS DYNAMIC. app/progress touches `document` at module scope
 * and the web suite runs in node with no DOM, which is the same measured
 * reason LessonGems.tsx records for lazy-loading its balance. A static import
 * here would redden every test that mounts a runner.
