/**
 * The glyphs that give the 2D scene depth, shared by the draw canvas and the
 * playback renderer so the handoff between them does not go flat.
 *
 * What the Alchemie capture (docs/reference/alchemie/01-mechanism-canvas-full.png)
 * shows, taken as pattern and redrawn in Blueberry's own palette:
 *   - atoms are shaded spheres: an off centre highlight, a darker rim, a soft
 *     drop shadow, so they read as objects rather than discs
 *   - bonds are thick capsules with rounded ends that meet the atom SURFACE,
 *     never the centre, because a cylinder that pokes into a sphere is a
 *     drawing, and one that stops at its skin is a thing
 *   - the implicit hydrogen count sits on a faint arc outside the sphere
 *   - the charge badge is a small shaded disc with its own shadow
 *
 * Everything here is pure SVG. The gradients and the shadow filter are
 * declared once per <svg> through DepthDefs; the sphere and capsule reference
 * them by id. feDropShadow with a small blur is the cheapest shadow SVG has,
 * and it is applied to one group per species rather than per atom so the
 * playback renderer's 60 renders per second stay inside budget.
