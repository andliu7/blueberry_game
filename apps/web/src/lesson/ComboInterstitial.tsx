/**
 * The combo interstitial: a full screen beat between two problems when the
 * student has hit 3, 5 or 8 correct in a row.
 *
 * The bar's shape, which is what a critic compares against: the lesson stops,
 * the character rises from the bottom edge, one line in a speech bubble
 * beside it, a Continue that acknowledges on pointer down. The header keeps
 * the lesson's progress bar so the student still knows where they are.
 *
 * Three rules from the round 2 verdict, each of which this file answers:
 *
 * 1. The stage owns the viewport from its FIRST frame. Round 1 faded the whole
 *    stage in over 200 ms, so the 0 ms frame was the dimmed lesson showing
 *    through an almost transparent ground, with "Leave" and "Finish lesson"
 *    ghosting under the mascot. The ground is now opaque with no opacity
 *    animation at all; only the things ON the ground move (the count pops,
 *    the berry rises, the bubble follows).
 * 2. The run count is the largest element on screen. It sits at the centre in
 *    the display face, the same treatment RewardMoment gives the session
 *    number, because a run of three is the smaller sibling of that moment.
 * 3. The vertical space is used. Header, then the count with its milestone
 *    track (3, 5, 8 with the ones reached lit, so the number says where it
 *    sits in the escalation), then the character and its line, then Continue.
 *    The count block and the character block each take half of what is left
 *    (both flex-1), so on a phone the character is centred in the lower half
 *    rather than pinned to the footer with a void above it.
 *
 * And one thing the probe of this round showed: the rise is CLIPPED. The
 * character row hides overflow, so at 0 ms the berry is emerging from the
 * row's bottom edge, the way the bar's character rises from the footer rule,
 * instead of being painted over the Continue button on its first frame.
 *
 * The line is specific to what the student did (count and topic) per the
 * voice rule in CLAUDE.md. Loss never appears here: the track only ever lights
 * up, per the token rule that a streak surface never counts down.
