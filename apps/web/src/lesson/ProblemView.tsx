/**
 * One authored problem on screen, in whichever of the five answer kinds it is.
 *
 * The curriculum package already separates the authored AnswerSpec from the
 * student's AnswerState, so this component's only job is to turn touches into
 * an AnswerState and hand it up. It never grades: the lesson does, through
 * gradeAttempt, so grading stays in one place and this stays a view.
 *
 * The five kinds, and what each renders:
 *   multiple_choice  a list of pressable options
 *   major_product    the candidate products, then the reasons (a two part pick)
 *   numeric          a text field and a unit field
 *   reagents         one or more reagent fields, ordered when the spec is a sequence
 *   structure        handed to the trainer; this shell cannot draw a structure yet
 *
 * The structure kind is the honest gap: the interaction package has a
 * structure draft and chem-core can compare constitutions, but a structure
 * EDITOR on this canvas is Ketcher territory (docs/INHERITED-DECISIONS.md D2)
 * and that route is lazy by budget. Until it exists, a structure problem says
 * so and lets the student skip without penalty.
 *
 * EVERY KIND FILLS ITS WELL, and that is the S3 judge's dead-zone carry
 * arriving here. LessonPlayer used to push this component to the bottom of a
 * full-height card with an `mt-auto`, which left a hole rather than filling a
 * screen. The card gives this component a growing well now, so every branch
 * below is a full-height flex column: the option rows stretch to share the
 * room (the committed frame's big option cards), and a form puts its caption
 * and its action at the bottom edge where the thumb is.
 *
 * THE CHECK IS A CHIP, NOT AN OUTLINE. The other half of the same carry was
 * "an outlined Check whose disabled state is ambiguous". Press's disabled
 * state is the live button at opacity 0.6, which reads as "maybe"; the
 * committed button-types sheet draws the disabled action as a DIFFERENT
 * OBJECT, flat grey with its 3D edge gone, so it no longer looks pressable at
 * all. That is beats/ChipPress.tsx, and every commit action on this surface
 * is one. Press stays on SKIP, which the same sheet draws as an outline.
 *
 * THE PICTURES, owner rulings 1 and 2 of 2026-09-04. Every question carries a
 * real visual and option cards are pictures with captions. The curriculum
 * `Problem` type still carries no figure field and its options are still
 * `{ id, text }`, so the drawings come from `lessonFigures.ts`, a shim keyed
 * on the corpus's own ids that borrows onboarding/figures.ts's vocabulary and
 * its one renderer. Read that file's header for why the table is in the app
 * rather than in the package, and for what stops it being invented chemistry.

 * ink. That is what this renders when `lessonFigures.ts` has a figure for the
 * option, and it is the whole reason that table exists.
 *
 * IT FALLS BACK TO THE WORDS, on purpose. A question authored after the

 * caption at the body ink and marks itself `data-visual="name"`, which is the
 * countable signal that the gap is there. `test/lessonFigures.test.ts` is
