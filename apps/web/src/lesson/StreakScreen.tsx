/**
 * The streak screen. It plays once, after the reward moment, on the day today
 * first counted, and it is the piece the bar keeps on a page of its own.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. The reward moment answers "what did this lesson pay". This
 * screen answers a different question, the one docs/ECONOMY.md says the streak
 * exists to answer: "am I still the kind of person who does this". Those are two
 * questions and the bar gives them two screens, which is the single clearest
 * thing to take from it here.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT, and this is the load bearing half. It is never a punishment
 * screen and it never frames a day as something lost. The bar's own version of
 * this screen ends on "Practicing daily grows your streak, but skipping a day
 * resets it!", which is the anxiety loop CLAUDE.md's 2026-08-27 amendment
 * answered rather than adopted: the mitigations are the product, so the same
 * slot on our screen carries the rest day announcement instead. Streak AT RISK
 * belongs to the header alone (P3), and nothing on this screen counts down.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER IS READ. ECONOMY.md, Anti-abuse: "The client animates what the
 * server concluded." The day count is `receipt.streak.current`, the milestone
 * and its diamonds are receipt lines, the freezes held and the exam window are
 * snapshot fields, and the seven day strip is seven answers from
 * `deriveEconomy` (see streakModel.ts, which explains how and why). Nothing on
 * this screen is added up here.
 *
 * HOW THE SEQUENCE IS ORCHESTRATED. One clock, the same shape RewardMoment.tsx
 * uses: elapsed milliseconds since mount, one requestAnimationFrame loop, every
 * beat a start time on it, a tap skips to the end and reduced motion starts
 * there. The two hooks are deliberately not shared yet: this piece was built
 * with the reward moment frozen, so extracting the hook out of it is a change
 * that belongs to whichever piece is allowed to touch both.
 *
 *   0      the flame lands out of a small spark ring, and the number is
 *          already on screen holding YESTERDAY's count
 *   260    "day streak" arrives under it
 *   420    the number ticks up by one and pops. This is the beat the bar does
 *          not have: it announces a total that was already true, and this
 *          screen shows the day being added
 *   640    the week card arrives, and its squares cascade in from 700, 55 ms
 *          apart, so the row reads
 *          left to right as a week rather than appearing as a block. Today's
 *          square is last and lands with the one halo on the row
 *   1250   the sentence under the hairline
 *   1700   the milestone band, on the days there is one
 *   1950   the freezes
 *   2500   done
 *
 * THE CARD IS MOUNTED FROM FRAME ZERO and only its contents are gated, so the
 * layout never moves under the four frame burst. A screen that reflows between
 * 400 ms and 900 ms is a screen whose stills cannot be compared.
