/**
 * A lesson: the problems of one topic, one at a time, graded by the curriculum
 * package, ending in the reward moment.
 *
 * Why the lesson is "a topic's problems" and not an authored lesson object:
 * the curriculum corpus carries a topic on every problem and a LessonId on
 * none of them yet (ids.ts reserves the alias for Phase 5 and the authoring
 * waves have not filled it). Grouping by topic is the honest unit the data
 * supports today; when lessons are authored, this component takes a problem
 * list from them instead and nothing else changes.
 *
 * State is a small reducer-free useState set, because the flow is linear:
 * index, the current result, the tally. A useReducer would be ceremony here.
 *
 * Grading calls gradeAttempt and nothing else, so the tier order (notation
 * causes, authored distractors, diagnostic causes, the logged tail) is the
 * package's decision and this file cannot reorder it by accident.
 *
 * TWO STAGES AT THE END, piece P4, 2026-08-28. The reward moment answers what
 * this lesson paid; the streak screen answers whether the student is still the
 * kind of person who does this. They are two questions, so they get two
 * screens, which is what the bar does. The second one plays only when today
 * counted for the FIRST time on this clear, and that fact is asked of the
 * engine on both sides of the commit rather than worked out here: a streak
 * screen a student sees three times in an evening is a screen they learn to tap
 * through.
 *
 * BLOOM'S REACTIONS, piece P1, 2026-08-27. The character has an opinion in
 * the same render as the grade: `submit` decides the outcome and the run, and
 * `reactionFor` (src/mascot/berryReaction.ts) turns those into the face, the
 * motion and the state. Nothing here names a mood directly, so the lesson and
 * the trainer make the same face for the same outcome. The two timers below
 * are the tone rule: a sad face settles inside a second, and a charred berry
 * clears with a flash on the next correct answer, never on a clock.

    // the approved lesson concept shows: a cream field edge to edge with the
    // controls low, not a small card floating in a field of ground.
    //
    // TWO GROWTH CLAUSES BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO MOUNTS, and ONE OF THEM DOES
    // NOT WORK TODAY. In onboarding the parent is a flex column, so `flex-1`
    // is the clause that fires and this column fills it.

    // Inside the shell it does not, and the previous note here claimed it did.

    // reduction_ladder: `main` is 670px tall and this column comes out 497,
    // leaving 173px of bare ground under the card. The cause is that Shell's
    // `main` is `display: block` (classes `min-h-0 flex-1`), so `flex-1` here
    // is inert, and a percentage min-height against a parent whose SPECIFIED
    // height is auto resolves to auto no matter what height flexbox later gave
    // it. `min-h-full` and `max-h-full` are both no-ops in that mount.
    //
    // THE FIX IS ONE CLASS IN A FILE THIS BUILDER DOES NOT OWN: `main` needs
    // `flex flex-col` beside the `min-h-0 flex-1` it already carries, and then
    // this column's `flex-1` fires in both mounts and the well below scrolls
    // rather than the page. Reported to the integrator rather than worked

    // heights into a calc() here, which breaks silently the next time the
