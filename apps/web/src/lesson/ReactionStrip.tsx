/**
 * The band under a graded answer: one colour for the moment, Bloom inside
 * it reacting, the headline, the explanation, and the Continue.
 *
 * Why the character moves INTO the strip. Before this the berry sat beside
 * the prompt and the feedback card appeared two elements below it, so the
 * face and the colour that meant the same thing were 300 px apart and read as
 * two events. The bar draws the outcome as one band with the icon in it. Here
 * the icon is the character, so the strip owns the berry while a result is on
 * screen and the prompt owns it while the student is working. React remounts
 * the berry on that move, which is fine: the reaction starts on grading, and
 * a freshly mounted berry blends from rest into the squash on its first frame.
 *
 * The tone is data on the element (`data-reaction`) and the colours are
 * custom properties set in theme.css, so the strip has one markup for the
 * three moments and the contrast audit sees three composed pairs.
