/**
 * The short form video slot inside a lesson, per the content pipeline rules in
 * CLAUDE.md: never autoplaying with sound, always skippable, transcript stored
 * with the video, and the lesson stands without it.
 *
 * Today no video exists, so this renders the slot with the real chrome and
 * says "Template" on its face, the same honesty the sibling repo's
 * lesson-video.tsx practises: a convincing placeholder that is not marked as
 * one is a trap for whoever opens the page next. When a clip lands, `src`
 * becomes a real URL and the <video> element below takes over: `muted` by
 * default, `controls` on, no `autoplay` attribute, ever.
 *
 * THE UNFILMED SLOT IS A STRIP, NOT A HERO, and that is a measured fix rather
 * than a taste one. The placeholder used to render at the real player's 16:9,
 * which on a 390 by 844 phone is about 220 CSS pixels of near-black card
 * sitting between the lesson's top bar and its question: the first thing the
 * student sees on a free lesson was a rectangle saying nothing is filmed, and
 * the question itself opened below the fold. CLAUDE.md's content pipeline is
 * explicit that "nothing in the free tier depends on video being present, so
 * lessons must stand without them"; a slot that costs a quarter of the screen
 * to say it is empty is that lesson not standing. So the UNFILMED state is a
 * one-row strip that keeps every promise the hero kept (it is marked as a
 * template, it names the concept, it is skippable, the transcript is reachable)
 * and gives the room back to the chemistry. A REAL clip keeps the 16:9 player,
 * because then the room is buying something.
