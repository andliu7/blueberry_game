/**
 * The pKa settings surface: match the numbers to your professor.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN EXISTS AT ALL, restated from settings/pka.ts because this is
 * the file a reader lands on first. The pKa ladder is the source course's
 * spine, the first question on six of six exams examined is pKa recall, and the
 * number a student is marked against is the number their own lecturer put on
 * the board. Those disagree in real ways: the course handout prints water at 16
 * where a standard reference prints 15.7. A student who sees 15.7 here and 16
 * on their key stops trusting the app, which is a worse outcome than either
 * number being wrong.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCREEN IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE. Displayed NUMBERS, and nothing else.
 * The authored orderings are not configurable, and where a configured value
 * would contradict one, this page SAYS SO in the flag panel below instead of
 * either throwing the student's number away or quietly re-ordering a problem a
 * person wrote and reviewed. All three of those are decisions in
 * settings/pka.ts; this file only renders them.
 *
 * THE STRUCTURE, top to bottom, and it is deliberately the order of the
 * questions a student asks: what is this, whose table am I on, is anything
 * wrong, and then the ladder itself with the rung they came to change.
 *
 * WHERE THIS SCREEN IS REACHED FROM, stated because today the answer is
 * nowhere. app/routes.ts has no `settings` tab and it belongs to the
 * integration agent, so this component is written and exported and not yet
 * mounted. The READING half is already live: SortBeatView subscribes to the
 * same store and resolves every card's number through `pkaValueFor`, so a
 * number changed here shows up in a lesson the moment the route exists.
 *
 * REACT PATTERNS NAMED, per CLAUDE.md's communication rules.
 *   - `useSyncExternalStore` subscribes this component to the settings store in
 *     settings/pka.ts. That store is a plain object with subscribe and
 *     getSnapshot, the same shape as app/progress.ts, so the state lives
 *     outside React and any other surface reading the same store re-renders
 *     with this one.
 *   - `LadderRow` is a child component per rung holding its own draft text in
 *     `useState`. One state variable in the parent holding sixteen drafts would
 *     re-render every row on every keystroke; a row that owns its own draft
 *     re-renders alone.
 *   - `PresetChooser` uses a ROVING TABINDEX, which is how a real radio group
 *     behaves: one tab stop for the whole group, arrow keys to move inside it.
 *     Its own comment says why claiming role="radio" without it is worse than
 *     not claiming it.
 *   - `useRef` plus `useEffect` for the two places focus and scroll are moved
 *     by hand, because React does neither for you: focusing the field when the
 *     editor opens, and bringing a saved row back into view after the ladder
 *     re-sorts around it.
 *   - `useId` gives the rejection paragraph an id unique to its row, so the
 *     input can point `aria-errormessage` at ITS message and not at another
 *     row's.
 *   - Every control fires on `onPointerDown` for the acknowledgement AND on
 *     `onClick` so a keyboard works, which is safe because the store's setters
 *     are idempotent. That is the CLAUDE.md press contract: the pressed state
 *     is the first frame of feedback and nothing here waits on it.
