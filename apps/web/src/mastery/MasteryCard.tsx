/**
 * The mastery rank card: the visible answer to the only question a student is
 * actually anxious about, which docs/ECONOMY.md states in its own words as
 * "whether they will be okay on the exam".
 *
 * IT RENDERS, IT NEVER DECIDES. CLAUDE.md: the rating is Elo-like and computed
 * server side from the append-only attempt history, and "the client RENDERS it
 * and never decides it". Phase 6 swaps `app/progress.ts`'s local source for a
 * Supabase-backed one; nothing on this screen changes when it does, because
 * every number here is already read off an `EconomySnapshot` and none of it is
 * computed in a component. `masteryModel.ts` carries the whole reading.
 *
 * THE ORDER ON THE CARD IS ECONOMY.MD'S FIRST PRESENTATION RULE, and it is the
 * one thing here that is not a matter of taste: "Lead with the sentence, not the
 * number. 'You can now predict E2 products' first, 34 second." So, top to
 * bottom:
 *
 *   the badge and its name   the picture first and the word second, per owner
 *                            ruling 2 of 2026-09-04. The mark is what the rank
 *                            IS; the name is a caption on it
 *   the claim                the sentence. Body size, body ink, above the number
 *   the bar and its reading  the number, and it is never larger than the claim
 *   the restore row          only when something is cracking. A count of things
 *                            to do and a one-tap fix, never a number that fell
 *   the ladder               the six ranks, so the badge is legibly scarce
 *
 * WHAT DECAY IS ALLOWED TO LOOK LIKE, and this is the rule this file exists to
 * hold: nothing on this card can render a loss. There is no delta, no arrow, no
 * "was", no red, and no countdown, because ECONOMY.md forbids all of them and
 * DESIGN-TOKENS adds that "a streak, charge or mastery surface never uses the
 * critical or error ramp, never counts down, and never animates a number
 * falling". The restore row is what decay produces instead, and it is phrased
 * as work available rather than ground lost.
 *
 * THE VOICE. A coach on the student's side: no scolding, no "you should have",
 * no rhetorical questions. "3 lessons are cracking. A review brings them back."
 * names what happened and makes the next action feel like three taps, which is
 * what it is.
