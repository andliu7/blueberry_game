/**
 * One card, front and back. Read this header before trusting anything in this
 * file.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE REFERENCE'S SHAPE, and it is worth naming what was taken.
 * docs/reference/competitors/orgosolver-02-flashcard-decks.png, right hand
 * phone: a small grey kind label at the top under a hairline, the structure
 * drawn large in the middle, tag chips, then the question, then a quiet "tap
 * to reveal" line at the bottom right. That layout puts the picture where the
 * eye lands first and the instruction where it is needed last, which is the
 * right order for a card you are trying to answer in your head.
 *
 * WHAT IS OURS AND NOT THEIRS: the third field. A card here carries `why` as
 * well as an answer, so the back TEACHES rather than only confirming. That is
 * the field cards/types.ts exists to protect and it is the reason a card
 * reviewed cold six weeks later still explains itself.
 *
 * THE THREE-SIDED FACE, and this is the clause the round 2 build missed.
 * DESIGN-GOALS locks reaction cards as three-sided, Setup / Conditions /
 * Product, switched by a segmented pill with the active segment filled and
 * the inactive ones outlined. Round 2 implemented that in the AUTHORING
 * composer only: `card.sides` was read nowhere but tray.ts, for the name, and
 * a composed card reviewed as a flat front/back with its conditions flattened
 * into a "Conditions: ..." prose line. The card a student actually REVIEWS is
 * the one the goals are about, so a card that carries `sides` now reviews on
 * the same pill it was written on. A card without sides (a lesson card, an
 * imported card, a miss from the journal) has no three sides to switch and
 * renders exactly as before; inventing sides for it would be a lie about
 * where its text came from.
 *
 * PRODUCT IS THE REVEAL. On a three-sided card the pill IS the reveal
 * gesture: Setup and Conditions are the question, Product is the answer, so
 * pressing Product before the reveal reveals. That also settles the HTML,
 * which would otherwise be a button inside a button: a sided face is a plain
 * div carrying real segment buttons, and it is the segments rather than the
 * whole card that take the press. An unsided face keeps the whole-card button
 * it always had.
 *
 * ONE ELEMENT, TWO FACES, and this is deliberate. Front and back are the same
 * bordered box with the back's content revealed inside it, not two boxes that
 * swap. A flip animation looks good once and costs a student the answer's
 * position on screen every single time, and the reveal is a moment where they
 * are comparing what they thought against what is written.
 *
 * `.press` gives the pointer-down acknowledgement in CSS with no JavaScript
 * in the way, which is what CLAUDE.md's under 100 ms contract asks for; the
 * reveal itself then runs on click so a keyboard reaches it too.
