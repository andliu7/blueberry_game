/**
 * The Cards landing, as pure functions over a snapshot. Read this header
 * before trusting anything in this file.
 *
 * THE DECISION THE SCREEN OPENS ON, per the design goals: review, not
 * browsing. So the first thing this file computes is the hero: one number,
 * and the queue that number promises. THEY ARE THE SAME COMPUTATION. The
 * number is the length of the queue the REVIEW button starts, derived once in
 * `reviewQueue`, because a hero that says 23 over a session that runs 19 is
 * the exact dishonesty the S3 judge scored against the bar. The cutoff is the
 * END of the local day, scheduler.ts's own `endOfLocalDay`, so the number
 * does not grow under the student's thumb at 8:59pm; the wall-clock lesson in
 * the gauntlet log is honoured by taking `now` as an argument everywhere.
 *
 * MY MISTAKES IS A FIRST CLASS DECK, fed by the trainer's journal (the Tier 2
 * distractor log plus the Tier 1 causes). A journal entry is not a card;
 * cards/Recommendation.tsx already owns the bridge (`draftCardFromMistake`,
 * which refuses rather than invents when no authored copy exists), and this
 * file only assembles: journal entries drafted into cards, deduplicated
 * against the copies already saved in the store, which keep their earned
 * schedule. The tile is always in the grid, even at zero, because a first
 * class deck that vanishes when empty reads as a feature that comes and goes.
 *
 * AUTO AGAINST AUTHORED, at a glance: decks generated from lessons carry the
 * `auto` marker (the lightning bolt) and live in their own row; decks a
 * student made or imported are the grid. The marker is data here and a glyph
 * in the component, so a test can assert the split without rendering.
 *
 * Pure: no storage, no clock reads, no React. The journal arrives as an
 * argument so this file never touches localStorage itself.
