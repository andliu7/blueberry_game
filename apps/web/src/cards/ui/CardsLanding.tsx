/**
 * The Cards tab landing. Read this header before trusting anything in this
 * file.
 *
 * THE COMMITTED IMAGE IS blueberry_cards-landing in docs/reference/design-goals,
 * and its order, top to bottom, is a decision this file only renders: the tab
 * OPENS ON THE REVIEW DECISION, not on browsing. First the Due-today hero, a
 * periwinkle chip with one big number and a green REVIEW fill; then the
 * My-decks grid, each tile a structure doodle, a count and a thin green
 * mastery bar, with "+ New deck" beside the heading and My mistakes as a
 * first-class member of the grid; then the From-your-lessons row, every deck
 * in it carrying the lightning auto marker so authored and auto-collected
 * decks read differently at a glance.
 *
 * EVERY NUMBER COMES FROM landing.ts, which derives the hero's number and the
 * REVIEW queue from the same computation, so the button can never start a
 * different session than the one the number promised. This file holds no
 * arithmetic at all; it is the pixels over that file's model, which is what
 * lets test/cardsLanding.test.ts assert the numbers without rendering.
 *
 * THE CLOCK IS READ ONCE PER RENDER and handed down, per the gauntlet log's
 * wall-clock rule: the surface takes `now` as an injectable so a test can ask
 * about any hour, and the default reads the real clock at render, not at
 * module load.

            name ("peeking and leaning poses are wanted").

            ROUND 3 MADE IT ACTUALLY BREAK THE OUTLINE. The critic measured
            the round 2 berry as fully contained inside the hero's rounded
            rectangle, touching neither the bottom nor the right edge, which
            is what -bottom-6 right-0 comes to once BlueberryMark's own
            viewBox padding is counted: the drawn berry fills about 72 percent
            of its box, so its visible edge stopped short of a corner it was
            nominally sitting on. At 128px, with the box pushed 36px below the
            hero and 24px past its right edge, the berry's lower body and its
            right side cross the outline the way the drawing's do, and the
            drawn berry comes to roughly 55 percent of the hero's height,
            which is the image's own proportion. .hero-chip carries
            overflow: visible so the crossing is drawn rather than clipped,
            and the 8px of horizontal overhang lands inside the page's own
            16px padding, so nothing overflows at 320px.

            WHAT IS STILL SHORT OF THE IMAGE, AND WHY IT IS NOT FIXED HERE.
            The drawn berry has green leaves, arms and legs; BlueberryMark
            draws a violet star calyx and no limbs. That art lives in
            apps/web/src/mascot/BlueberryMark.tsx, which is shared by every
            surface in the app and is not this piece's to edit during a
            fan-out round, and DESIGN-GOALS' own rule is that the mascot is
            IMPORTED, never redrawn: growing limbs on a copy inside cards/
            would fork the character rather than close the gap. It is reported
            as a blocker for the mascot's owner. The pose, the size and the
            placement are the part this file can honestly supply, and they
            are supplied. */}
