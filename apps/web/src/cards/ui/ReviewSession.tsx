/**
 * The review session. Read this header before trusting anything in this file.
 *
 * THE LOOP: a card front, tap to reveal, then Again, Hard, Good, Easy. That is
 * the Anki borrow CLAUDE.md names, and the instruction beside it is "take the
 * scheduler, leave the interface". So this screen is not Anki's grid of blue
 * boxes. It is the reference's single tall card
 * (docs/reference/competitors/orgosolver-02-flashcard-decks.png, right hand
 * phone) with a thin progress rule and an Exit at the top, and it carries the
 * four ratings that Anki's grid was hiding underneath a menu.
 *
 * THE BUTTONS SAY WHEN THE CARD COMES BACK. `scheduler.nextInterval` is pure
 * and was split out for exactly this, so Good reads "Good, 8 days". It turns a
 * mood rating into a choice with a visible consequence, and it is the one
 * piece of Anki's interface worth keeping.
 *
 * WHERE THE STATE LIVES. The session's own state is a reducer in session.ts,
 * so the queue and the counter can be replayed in a test. The card's SCHEDULE
 * is not this component's business: `source.rate` is the seam, the local store
 * behind it asks scheduler.ts what a rating does, and Phase 6 swaps a Supabase
 * backed source in without touching this file.
 *
 * VOICE. Nothing on this screen scolds. Again is a normal step and the copy
 * treats it as one, which is not a nicety: a student who feels judged for
 * pressing Again presses Good instead, and the scheduler is then working from
 * a lie. The one system the whole surface exists to feed depends on honest
 * self reports.

 * the goal-green GO fill under dark ink (the fill-only rule's legal shape),
 * Easy is the teal alt-route family.
 *
 * ROUND 3 MADE HARD AND EASY SOLID. They were --warn-soft-solid and
 * --alt-route-soft, pale tints carrying their token's dark hue as TYPE, so
 * the row alternated solid, pale, solid, pale and the two pale chips read as
 * switched off beside their neighbours. The sheet draws four saturated fills
 * of one weight; cards.css carries the sampled values and the measured inks.
 *
 * AGAIN IS THE ONE DIVERGENCE FROM THE SHEET AND IT IS DELIBERATE. The sheet
 * draws it red; CLAUDE.md rules that red is for destructive acts and never
 * for a student learning, and DESIGN-TOKENS' 2026-08-27 amendment says a
 * retention surface never uses the error ramp. A student who feels judged for
 * pressing Again presses Good instead, and the scheduler is then working from
 * a lie, which is the one input this whole surface exists to collect. So
 * Again takes the periwinkle chip family: still plainly live, still its own
 * hue in a four-hue row, and no longer the --muted face it used to wear,
 * which was also the DISABLED chip's face and read as switched off.
