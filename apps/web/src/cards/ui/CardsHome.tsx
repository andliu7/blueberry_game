/**
 * The Cards tab, all four faces behind one component. Read this header before
 * trusting anything in this file.
 *
 * THE FACES, and the design-goals clause each one implements:
 *
 *   landing   CardsLanding. The tab OPENS on the review decision: Due-today
 *             hero, My-decks grid, From-your-lessons row.
 *   review    ReviewSession. Structure on the card, four grade chips with
 *             the scheduler's own intervals on them.
 *   composer  Composer. Three-sided reaction cards, Setup / Conditions /
 *             Product on a segmented pill, Save to deck.
 *   tray      DeckTray. The fanned browser over the violet tray.
 *
 * This file owns exactly the transitions between them and nothing that any
 * face computes. It is the one component the shell needs to mount, so the
 * integrator's whole wiring job is rendering CardsHome where MyDeck was.
 *
 * WHY DRAFTS ARE ADOPTED BEFORE A SESSION. The mistakes deck is assembled at
 * render time from the trainer's journal (landing.ts), so a drafted card can
 * reach the REVIEW button without ever having been saved. The store's rate()
 * deliberately ignores ids it does not hold, which would silently drop the
 * rating; adopting the draft into the stored mistakes deck first gives the
 * rating somewhere to land, and the saved copy then wins every later
 * assembly, keeping the schedule it just earned. That is the "materialises
 * in the store the first time it is reviewed" moment landing.ts promises.
 *
 * The bar-hiding contract is CardsTab's: this component reports immersion
 * through onImmersiveChange from an effect, so leaving by any route restores
 * the bar, the same reasoning as the previous wiring.
