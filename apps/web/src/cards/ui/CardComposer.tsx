/**
 * The composer: a student writes a three-sided reaction card. Read this
 * header before trusting anything in this file.
 *
 * THE COMMITTED IMAGE IS blueberry_r6-composer in docs/reference/design-goals,
 * and round 3 is a visual-fidelity pass, so what it draws is the list this
 * file is measured against. Top to bottom the image holds exactly five
 * things: the Setup / Conditions / Product segmented pill, one large cream
 * editing card with a heavy near-black outline holding a centred question
 * line over a drawn reaction scheme, the three side previews fanned beneath
 * it, three page dots, and Save to deck as the screen's dominant bottom
 * element, a wide violet 3D pill fully visible directly above the tab bar.
 * Nothing else. The draft text inside the image is model gibberish; the
 * layout, the colours and the depth are what bind.
 *
 * WHAT ROUND 3 CHANGED, against the critic's measured list.
 *
 * THE SAVE CHIP IS ON THE SCREEN NOW. It was measured at top=793 on a 390x844
 * phone whose fixed tab bar starts at 768, with the document 998px tall: the
 * primary act of the whole face was painted under the bar and off screen on
 * first paint. Two things put it back. The column is SIZED TO THE SPACE IT
 * HAS through useFillHeight (which measures rather than copying a header
 * height out of another owner's stylesheet), and the editing card is the only
 * member that flexes, so the fixed rows keep their sizes and the card gives
 * up the difference.
 *
 * THE "SAVE INTO" BLOCK IS GONE, and that is the other half of the same fix:
 * a bordered card holding a label, a deck <select> and a "Name the new deck"
 * input sat between the page dots and the save chip, appears nowhere in the
 * image, and was precisely what pushed the save chip under the bar. The
 * destination did not disappear with it. It is a DECK CHIP in the composer's
 * own top row, which is a better place for it on its own merits: it says
 * where the card is going before the student writes the card rather than
 * after, it is the thing the save animation can arc INTO, and it opens a
 * chooser sheet for the rarer act of picking a different deck or naming a new
 * one. With no deck yet the target is "My cards", created on the first save,
 * so Save to deck is never blocked by a naming step the image does not draw.
 *
 * THE EDITING CARD IS A REACTION SCHEME. The image draws a centred question
 * line above structures, an arrow, and the conditions written over that
 * arrow; round 2 drew a left-aligned SETUP caption over one plain textarea in
 * a white box with a slate border. So the scheme IS the editor here: setup on
 * the left, product on the right, conditions over the arrow between them, and
 * the side the pill has selected is the one highlighted and focused. The card
 * is warm ivory with the image's heavy near-black outline and its thick
 * bottom slab, per cards.css.
 *
 * THE SAVE-TO-DECK MOTION IS PERFORMED, which DESIGN-GOALS' Cards section
 * requires and round 2 did not do on the surface the image actually names:
 * tap, the card scales to 0.92, arcs to the deck icon, +1 badge. The ghost is
 * a fixed-position copy of the editing card's box; both rects are measured at
 * the moment of the save, so one keyframe serves any two positions. It is
 * cleared by a timer rather than by onAnimationEnd, because under reduced
 * motion the ghost is display:none and an animation that never runs never
 * ends.
 *
 * WHERE THE LOGIC LIVES: composer.ts, all of it pure. This file owns exactly
 * the React state (which side is active, the draft, where it saves) and the
 * pixels.
 *
 * FILENAME NOTE: this file is CardComposer.tsx rather than Composer.tsx
 * because composer.ts (the logic) lives beside it and Windows resolves the
 * two names case-insensitively, which makes "./Composer" ambiguous to tsc.

            "+ NBS", an arrow labelled hv/heat, a bromocyclopentene) with the
            names as small captions BENEATH the structures, while the build
            held three plain textareas on ruled lines, so the centrepiece of
            the composer was text where the reference is a drawing. The three
            mini side cards already carried sketches, which made the empty big
            card read as a missing element rather than a style.

            SO A STRUCTURE STANDS OVER EACH SIDE'S WRITING LINE, at the scale
            the image draws one, and the student's words are the caption under
            it exactly as they are in the drawing.

            WHAT THE SKETCH IS AND IS NOT, said here because a reader will
            otherwise assume more of it than is true: it is the same

            rendering of what the student typed. This phase has no structure
            editor, and drawing a molecule that claimed to be the student's
            reagent would be the composer lying about its own contents. It is
            aria-hidden, it never changes with the text, and the day a
            structure input exists it is what replaces this. Naming that here
            is the honest version of building the picture. */}
