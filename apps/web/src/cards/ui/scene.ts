/**
 * The deck tray's environment, as numbers. Read this header before trusting
 * anything in this file.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT FIVE LITERALS IN A COMPONENT. The background
 * doctrine of 2026-09-02 is a rule about METHOD, not about taste: the pathway
 * environment is COMPOSED, never scattered; props are placed by a
 * deterministic per-unit placement table; and "random per-route scatter of
 * icons or molecules is a defect a critic names". A table that lives in a
 * component is a claim nobody can check. A table that lives here is one
 * test/cardsScene.test.ts holds a ruler to, and the ruler is the point: a
 * later hand that reaches for Math.random, or that drops a cloud where the
 * fan covers it, fails a check rather than passing a review.
 *
 * WHERE A PROP MAY STAND is the one geometric fact worth stating out loud.
 * The props layer is pinned to the TOP of the scene and the scene stacks its
 * contents at the FOOT of the frame, so what a prop has to clear is the fan
 * and the tray that rise from that foot. SCENE_FAN_TOP, SCENE_ARC_TOP and
 * SCENE_LIFT_COLUMN below are those lines, derived from the built
 * composition, and the test holds every prop to them. A prop that fails them
 * is not a subtle prop, it is a prop nobody will ever see.
 *
 * THE PALETTE IS THE WARM-TECH ONE, AND ROUND 4 IS WHERE IT STOPPED HIDING.
 * Round 3 drew every prop at 0.12 opacity, under contrast-audit.mjs's own
 * published <0.15 skip threshold, so the gate never scored a single mark on
 * this face. It passed by not being measured. What a person then saw was the
 * defect the round 3 critic named: a desaturated grey-green sky where the
 * committed deck-tray image draws warm cream, tan terraces, ONE cloud filled
 * solid white and one drawn as a violet outline, and two flasks in warm tan.
 *
 * So the props are painted at full strength in the image's own families and
 * they are MEASURED rather than skipped. SCENE_PALETTE below carries every
 * hex and both grounds; test/cardsScene.test.ts computes the WCAG ratio of
 * each drawn line against the ground it sits on and holds it to the 3.0
 * graphics floor. That is a stronger check than the one it replaces, and it
 * is why the opacity assertion is gone rather than loosened.
 *
 * THE WHITE CLOUD IS WHITE, and it clears the gate the way the gate itself
 * says a shape may: contrast-audit.mjs collapses a shape's fill and stroke to
 * the BETTER of the two ("A shape is ONE component, not two"), so a white
 * cloud closed by a tan outline is identified by its outline. The image draws
 * that outline too; this is the drawing, not a dodge.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no DOM, no clock, no storage.

/**
 * WHERE A PROP MAY STAND, and round 4 replaced a single band with the two
 * lines the composition actually has.
 *
 * Round 3's rule was one number: every prop's whole extent above y=200,
 * "where the fan does not cover it". That rule was written when the fan was a
 * 188px band; the hand is 247px tall now (a shallow arc under a card lifted
 * most of its own height), so 200 stopped meaning what it says. It was also
 * stricter than the committed image, which puts two of its clouds BEHIND the
 * fan, either side of the raised card, and keeps only the raised card's own
 * column clear.
 *
 * So there are three lines, all derived from the built composition at the
 * 390x844 reference phone, and test/cardsScene.test.ts holds every prop to
 * them:
 *
 *   SCENE_FAN_TOP    102   the top of the fan's box inside the scene. The
 *                          scene runs 657px between the header's foot and the
 *                          tab bar, and it stacks 256 of fan, 40 of gap, 223
 *                          of tray and 36 of ground at the bottom, which
 *                          leaves 102 of open sky
 *   SCENE_ARC_TOP    232   where the resting hand's own cards begin. The fan
 *                          box is 256 tall and its arc fills the bottom 126 of
 *                          it, so 102 + 130
 *   SCENE_LIFT_COLUMN      the raised card's column: 72px of card at the 1.28
 *                          lift scale, centred, plus a little clearance
 *
 * A prop is legal if it is wholly in the sky, or if it is above the arc and
 * clear of the raised card's column. That is the image's own arrangement
 * stated as a bound rather than as a wish.
