/**
 * The composer's logic, with no React in it. Read this header before trusting
 * anything in this file.
 *
 * WHAT THE COMPOSER IS. The design goals lock reaction cards as THREE SIDED:
 * Setup, Conditions, Product, switched by a segmented pill. A student writing
 * their own card writes all three, and the card carries them verbatim in
 * `Card.sides`. The classic front/back/why triple is DERIVED here as well, so
 * every surface that predates sides (export, CSV, the imported-deck view)
 * still renders the card whole. One writer, one mapping, in one file.
 *
 * THE MAPPING, and why it is this way round. Front is the setup, because the
 * setup is what a reaction question shows you first. Back is the product,
 * because the product is the answer a student checks themselves against.
 * `why` carries the conditions, prefixed so it reads as a sentence on a
 * legacy face. Nothing here is authored teaching copy and nothing pretends to
 * be: a composed card is the student's own words, its source kind says so,
 * and it never routes through packages/feedback.
 *
 * VALIDATION IS A LIST OF SENTENCES, not a boolean. The save button's
 * disabled state has to say what is missing in the coach voice, and a
 * boolean cannot. An all-empty draft is simply "not ready yet", which is a
 * normal state and not an error.
 *
 * Pure: no storage, no clock reads (now arrives as an argument), no React.
