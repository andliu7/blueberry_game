/**
 * The card store. Read this header before trusting anything in this file.
 *
 * THE SEAM, in the same words app/progress.ts and tabs/trainer/mistakes.ts use:
 * localStorage here is a RENDERING CACHE and an OFFLINE DRAFT, never an
 * entitlement and never the record of record. Nothing paid is gated on it.
 * Phase 6 replaces `createLocalDecks` with a Supabase backed source that
 * reconciles this draft against the append only attempt history, and the
 * surfaces do not change because they read the `DeckSource` interface in
 * types.ts rather than this file. A student who edits localStorage has edited
 * a cache.
 *
 * THE STORE SHAPE is `subscribe` plus `getSnapshot`, the same external store
 * shape as app/progress.ts and packages/interaction/src/store.ts. A React
 * surface reads it with `useSyncExternalStore`, which is the built in hook for
 * subscribing to state that lives outside React: it takes the two functions
 * below and re-renders when `subscribe` fires. Nothing in this file imports
 * React, and that is the point of the shape.
 *
 * WHY A SNAPSHOT IS REPLACED AND NEVER MUTATED. `useSyncExternalStore` decides
 * whether to re-render by comparing the object identity of the snapshot. Push
 * a card into the existing object and the identity is unchanged, so the screen
 * does not update and the bug looks like a caching problem three files away.
 * Every write here builds a new snapshot object.
 *
 * THE CAP, same reasoning as mistakes.ts: a semester of drilling must not grow
 * an unbounded blob in a five megabyte store. Over CARD_CAP the OLDEST cards go
 * first, and their review states and deck memberships go with them, so the
 * store cannot hold a schedule for a card that no longer exists. Insertion
 * order is what "oldest" means, which is what a string-keyed object preserves.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DECIDE: intervals. Every scheduling question goes to
 * scheduler.ts, so there is exactly one place where "what does hard do" is
 * answered. The clock is injected for the same reason it is injected there.
