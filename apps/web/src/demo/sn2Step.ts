/**
 * The demo step: SN2 at bromomethane. Hydroxide attacks backside, bromide
 * leaves, one concerted step.
 *
 * Built through chem-core's real constructors, not hand-mocked JSON, so the
 * demo exercises the same validation every fixture passes and cannot drift
 * from the engine's data model. If chem-core tightens a rule this file fails
 * to build, which is the point.
 *
 * Layout hints are authored, not auto-placed, because THIS scene's composition
 * carries chemistry: the nucleophile must visibly approach from the side
 * opposite the leaving group, or the picture teaches frontside attack. The z
 * hints splay the three hydrogens out of plane so the 3D renderer has real
 * depth to show; the 2D renderer ignores z by design.
