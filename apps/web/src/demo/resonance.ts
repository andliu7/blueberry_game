/**
 * The resonance hunt. Owner direction, 2026-08-26: "include resonance
 * structures as well, like a 'you found a resonance structure' game mode. I
 * think that's where I want the arrows to go."
 *
 * Each entry is a real MechanismStep whose from and to states are two
 * contributing structures of ONE species: no sigma bond forms or breaks, no
 * atom moves, only pi bonds, lone pairs and formal charge relocate. The
 * route is chem-core's own "resonance", added for exactly this mode, so the
 * data never mislabels delocalisation as a reaction.
 *
 * Allyl cation is Unit 1's opening spine node in the pathway map ("draw and
 * rank allyl cation resonance forms"); acetate is the anion every pKa
 * argument in Unit 8 leans on. Both directions of the allyl pair are
 * entries, because finding B from A and A from B are different pushes.
