/**
 * Progress, as the SHELL sees it. Read this header before trusting anything
 * in this file.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md, non-negotiables: unlock state, diamond balances, ratings and
 * standings are enforced server side, and a client side value is a suggestion.
 * Phase 6 builds that server. Phase 5 has to render a pathway, a balance and a
 * reward moment today, so this file is the SEAM: one interface, ProgressSource,
 * that the tabs read through, and one implementation, the local store below,
 * that keeps a per-device copy in localStorage.
 *
 * What that local copy is: a rendering cache and an offline draft. What it is
 * not: an entitlement. Nothing paid is gated on it (the free tier is tutorial,
 * intro lessons, periodic table, five problems a day, all of which are free
 * here regardless), and Phase 6 replaces `createLocalProgress` with a Supabase
 * backed source that reconciles this draft against the append only attempt
 * history. A student who edits localStorage has edited a cache.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AT v2, and it is the reason this file is worth reading twice.
 * docs/ECONOMY.md, Anti-abuse: "Every balance is a derived column:
 * f(attempt history, spend history). Recomputable from scratch." So this store
 * no longer keeps a diamond count, an XP count, a streak, or a charge meter. It
 * keeps the JOURNAL, which is the list of things that happened, and every number
 * on screen comes out of `deriveEconomy(journal, now, options)` in
 * @blueberry/economy. The shape of the local cache is now the same shape the
 * server will hold, which is what makes the Phase 6 swap a change of transport
 * rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * The `options` is the COURSE, and `courseUniverse` below explains at length why
 * leaving it out was a bug rather than a default. In one line: mastery is scored
 * out of a course, and a shell that does not name one is scored out of whatever
 * it happened to unlock.
 *
 * The reward moment reads `lastReceipt` and animates it. It never adds anything
 * up itself: ECONOMY.md, "The client animates what the server concluded."
 *
 * ONE LIMITATION TO KNOW ABOUT. `economy` is recomputed on every commit and not
 * on every render, because useSyncExternalStore needs getSnapshot to return the
 * same object until something actually changes. Charge regenerates with the
 * clock, so a meter left on screen for an hour shows the value it had at the
 * last commit. A surface that needs a live meter should derive it itself with
 * `deriveEconomy(snapshot.journal, new Date().toISOString())` on its own timer,
 * which is cheap and is the honest way to do it. Phase 6's source will poll.
 * Charge does not depend on the course, so that call needs no universe. A
 * surface that re-derives MASTERY that way must pass `courseUniverse(course)`,
 * or it will show a different number from the pathway.
 *
 * The store is an external store (subscribe plus getSnapshot), the same shape
 * as packages/interaction/src/store.ts, so tabs read it with
 * useSyncExternalStore and nothing here imports React.

 * Mastery is "0 to 100 per course" (docs/ECONOMY.md), so the score has to be
 * divided by the whole course. The economy package can only see the journal, and
 * a node is unlocked there by node_started or node_cleared. This shell never
 * journals node_started for a lesson: LessonPlayer goes straight to
 * completeLesson, which appends the attempts and the clear. So without this, a
 * student's first finished lesson was one node cleared out of one node unlocked,
 * which is 100 percent, Exam Ready, and a receipt paying every rank award for one
 * lesson. deriveEconomy floors every denominator at
 * MASTERY_MIN_UNIVERSE_DIFFICULTY so that can never be a catastrophe; naming the
 * course is what makes the number MEAN something.
 *
 * The ids have to be the ids the journal uses, so this goes through
 * `lessonNodeId` exactly as `completeLesson` does. DAT and MCAT home no topics
 * and probe all four content courses, which is the right universe for a review
 * course: it is what they are actually measured over.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, and it is content rather than code. Gen Chem I homes 3 topics,
 * Gen Chem II 2 and Organic I 9, all narrower than the floor, so mastery on
 * those three caps below 100 until they are authored out. test/masteryUniverse
 * keeps the ledger of which courses those are.
