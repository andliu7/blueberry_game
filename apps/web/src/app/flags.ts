/**
 * Feature flags for the three surfaces that are built and not open yet.
 *
 * Owner amendment of 2026-08-28: leaderboards, AI chat and tutor messaging come
 * out of the tab bar and go behind a flag "rather than being deleted", and
 * every route still resolves so a deep link does not 404.
 *
 * A flag here decides ONE thing: whether the app LINKS to a surface. It never
 * decides whether the surface renders, because a student who typed the hash or
 * followed an old link has to land somewhere honest. The route always resolves;
 * with the flag off it renders the surface's own "not open yet" state.
 *
 * This is a CLIENT flag and it is deliberately not an entitlement. CLAUDE.md:
 * anything that costs money or gates access is enforced server side, and a
 * client side check is a suggestion. Nothing behind these flags costs money
 * today; when chat does, Phase 7's Edge Function meters it and this file is
 * still only deciding whether a link is drawn.
 *
 * Two ways to turn one on, both non-secret:
 *   ?flags=chat,leaderboards   for a capture script, a critic, or a demo
 *   localStorage["blueberry.flags"] = "chat"   for a device that has to keep it
 *
 * The URL wins, so a capture never inherits whatever the last session stored.

/**
 * BETA EXPLORATION FLAGS, owner request 2026-09-03: "unlock all of the buttons
 * so that I can access all of them from the pathway (beta version I suppose)"
 * and "give infinite charge".
 *
 * A SEPARATE TYPE, not three more FlagIds, and the type system is the reason
 * the difference got written down. A FlagId names a SURFACE that exists and is
 * not linked yet, so every FlagId has a route, a tab id and a "not open yet"
 * notice, and the compiler enforces that each one does. A BetaId names a RULE
 * suspended for exploration. It has no route, no tab and no notice, and folding
 * it into FlagId made three unrelated files claim it needed all three.
 *
 * Neither grants anything. Unlock state and any balance that costs money are
 * server enforced per CLAUDE.md and nothing here is consulted on that path.
 * These let the CLIENT draw the product as though the server had said yes,
 * which is a demo, not an entitlement. When Phase 6 puts the server behind
 * progress, these keep drawing a local preview and grant exactly nothing.
 *
 * On by ?flags=unlockall,infinitecharge or the same list in localStorage.
