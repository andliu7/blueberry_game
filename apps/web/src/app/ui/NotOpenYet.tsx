/**
 * What a flagged surface renders while its flag is off.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS EXISTS FOR. Owner amendment of 2026-08-28: leaderboards, chat
 * and tutor messages come out of the bar "rather than being deleted", and
 * "every route must still resolve so a deep link does not 404". A route that
 * resolves to nothing is a 404 with a 200 status code, so it resolves to this.
 *
 * mobile-ui has two empty states and this is neither of them exactly: it is not
 * a first run and it is not a search miss. It is the third case, a destination
 * that exists and is not open, and what it borrows from the other two is the
 * shape: say plainly what is true, do not read as a failure, and always leave a
 * way out that is not the back button.
 *
 * THE VOICE. CLAUDE.md: a coach on the student's side, never scolding, and
 * specific rather than generic. So each line names the ONE thing the surface is
 * waiting on and what is already being kept for it, because "coming soon" tells
 * a student nothing and "your attempts are already counted" tells them their
 * work is not being thrown away.
