/**
 * The one button. Every control in the shell is this or is styled like it.
 *
 * The press contract in CLAUDE.md: the pressed state renders on pointer down,
 * before any work happens. The `.press` class in theme.css does that through
 * `:active`, which the browser paints the same frame the pointer lands, with
 * no JavaScript in the path. `busy` continues the acknowledgement as a loading
 * affordance when the action takes time, so nothing ever waits silently.
 *
 * The minimum size is 44 by 44, the hit target floor in the Budgets table.
 *
 * EVERY VARIANT CARRIES A REAL OUTLINE AND NO SHADOW, and that is the lavender
 * turn arriving at button scale.
 *
 * On a cream card sitting on a lavender ground the card edge measures 1.96:1,
 * under the 3:1 a boundary needs, so the card carries a border. A control is the
 * same shape one level down: it is a sticker pressed onto the sheet, and what
 * makes a flat fill read as a cut-out is the cut, not a shadow under it.
 * Sticker rule 3 says the same thing from the other direction ("outlined buttons
 * are first-class, never a fallback") and rule 3's shadow ban applies to chrome
 * outright. So `shadow-sm` is gone from all four variants and a 2px outline is
 * on all four, INCLUDING ghost: a transparent border would satisfy a
 * border-width check and satisfy nothing a reader can see, which is the sort of
 * fix this repo does not make.
 *
 * The radius is 1rem rather than 9px. The sticker language's floor is 12px and
 * the audit was reporting 9 on this exact element, 28 rows of it.
 *
 * The reward variant WAS a two-stop gradient. Rule 2 forbids gradients outright
 * and the audit was right to say so; it is a flat fill of --accent-from now,
 * which carries white at 7.18:1.
