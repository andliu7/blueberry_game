/**
 * The header tools: the periodic table and the reaction search, reachable from
 * every tab and from inside a lesson.
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO ARE NOT TABS. Owner amendment of 2026-08-28, and mobile-ui says
 * the same thing in one line: "tabs are DESTINATIONS. Tools you reach for mid
 * task (a lookup, a reference table, search) belong in the header or a sheet,
 * not a tab. That reframing usually collapses a six-tab argument into four."
 *
 * A student does not decide to go to the periodic table. They are three steps
 * into an EAS problem and want to check an electronegativity. A tab makes that
 * a departure: the lesson unmounts, the progress bar goes, and coming back is a
 * second decision. A sheet makes it a glance. So the tools moved UP into the
 * header rather than out of the product, which is why CLAUDE.md's "interactive,
 * always reachable" is better served here than it was by a tab: the tab was not
 * reachable from inside a lesson at all, and this is.
 *
 * BOTH ARE STILL ROUTES. #/periodic and #/search resolve exactly as before, so
 * a bookmark, a shared link and the back button all work, and the deep link
 * #/periodic/Br still selects bromine. The route is the fallback and the shared
 * link; the sheet is the normal way in.
 *
 * LAZY, BOTH OF THEM. The periodic table carries 118 elements of data and the
 * search carries the reaction database. Neither belongs in the entry chunk that
 * a student opening a mechanism downloads, and CLAUDE.md's rule is that a heavy
 * import sits behind React.lazy with a real loading state and never a blank
 * rectangle. The skeleton is that state.
 *
 * WHY A <dialog>. Modality, focus trapping, Escape to close and the top layer,
 * all from the platform. Hand rolling those is three bugs. Same call and the
 * same comment as LanguagePicker.tsx and Hud.tsx.
 *
 * THE BUTTONS CARRY AN OUTLINE, and that is a deliberate difference from the
 * readouts beside them. Sticker rule 3: an outline is what makes an element
 * read as a pressable cut-out. The HUD's numbers are readings and are flat; a
 * tool is an object you pick up, so it gets a border. The header's two halves
 * are then two different KINDS of thing rather than seven chips at one weight,
 * which is the finding the P3 round already paid for.
