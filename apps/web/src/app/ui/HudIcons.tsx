/**
 * The four drawn marks in the header HUD: the XP ring, the diamond, the streak
 * flame, and the charge cell. Bloom is the imported mascot, never redrawn
 * (CLAUDE.md, and docs/INHERITED-DECISIONS.md D4), and since the S3 design pass
 * he is no longer one of the header's marks: see ChargeMark below.
 *
 * Every one is inline SVG with token fills. No sprite sheet, no icon font, no
 * emoji: an emoji flame is a different drawing on every platform and a font is
 * bytes the game route pays for on a budget that already counts them.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE CHUNKY. The bar's header marks are solid shapes with one lighter
 * facet and no outline, read at about 24px on a phone. A hairline stroke icon
 * at that size reads as a settings row rather than as a score, which is the
 * whole difference between a game HUD and an admin panel. So each mark here is
 * a filled silhouette plus exactly one lighter facet for volume, and nothing
 * else. The facet is a white or black wash at low alpha ON the mark, so it
 * never has to clear a contrast floor against the page: the silhouette does
 * that, in a token measured for it.
 *
 * The one place a stroke is right is the ring, because a ring IS a stroke: the
 * arc's length is the number.

/**
 * The daily goal ring. The full circle is the goal, so the ring carries the
 * goal tier by construction: a Casual student's circle closes at 10 XP and an
 * Exam mode student's at 60, and both read "how much of today is done".
 *
 * The arc is drawn with stroke-dasharray on a circle rotated a quarter turn, so
 * it starts at twelve o'clock. dashoffset is transitioned in hud.css, which is
 * why XP landing mid session animates the arc rather than jumping it.

/**
 * The streak flame. Two shapes: the body, and the inner tongue.

 * silhouette alone, and in the capture it read as a raindrop: what identifies
 * fire at 22px is the two tone core, not the outline. So an unlit flame keeps
 * its tongue at 0.42 alpha of the same grey, which is a lighter core on a grey
 * body, and hud.css leans the whole thing slowly from the base so it reads as
 * guttering rather than as disabled.
 *
 * The silhouette itself is asymmetric on purpose: the tip leans, and the right
 * shoulder carries the small fold a flame makes as it curls. A symmetric
 * teardrop is a drop of water, whatever colour it is filled with.
 *
 * ECONOMY.md's whole mitigation set argues against rendering an unmet day as a
 * loss, so the unlit flame is still a flame and there is no red anywhere near
 * it.

/**
 * The charge cell, and it is here because Bloom used to be.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACED AND WHY. The charge chip drew Bloom at 26px with his halo
 * set to the charge fraction. That was a nice idea and it cost more than it
 * paid, on two counts a measurement caught and a judge had already said in
 * words. The sticker audit's rule 10 counts mascot instances on one screen and
 * was reporting two on ten routes, three on seven and four on the charge ones,
 * unchanged across four rounds; P3's own round two judge wrote "the same
 * blueberry face appears four times on one screen, so the number that matters
 * fights five other glyphs". And inside the chip itself the fraction was drawn
 * TWICE, once as the halo's thickness at 26px where it is barely legible and
 * once as the meter under the word, where it is legible.
 *
 * So the chip keeps the meter, which is the reading, and takes a mark, which is
 * the identity. Bloom keeps the coach mark at 76px, where the halo really does
 * read as a meter gaining and losing weight, and keeps every full screen moment
 * he already owned. He appears once per screen now instead of two to four
 * times, which is what makes him a character rather than clip art.
 *
 * Drawn the same way as the diamond and the flame: a filled silhouette in the
 * family's own token, one lighter facet for volume, and the bolt cut out in the
 * card's colour so the shape is one component in both themes.
