 * The house card: warm cream on the lavender ground, 16px radius, 2px border.
 *
 * THE BORDER IS ARITHMETIC, NOT DECORATION. Cream #fbf3e6 on lavender #a3aee2
 * measures 1.96:1, under the 3:1 a boundary needs to be seen at all, so without
 * an outline this card has no edge. --border is derived against both surfaces
 * for exactly that: 6.11:1 on the card, 3.11:1 on the ground.
 *
 * `shadow-sm` is gone with it. Sticker rule 3 allows a shadow only where
 * stacking is the meaning, and a container is chrome; the audit counted 24 rows
 * of this one class. Depth here comes from the cut edge.
