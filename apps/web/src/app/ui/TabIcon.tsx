/**
 * One inline icon per tab id. Inline SVG rather than an icon package so the
 * shell's entry chunk carries a handful of glyphs and not a font.
 *
 * THE FIVE BAR ICONS ARE STICKERS, THE FIVE OFF-BAR ONES ARE GLYPHS, and that
 * is a deliberate split rather than an unfinished job.
 *
 * The bar's icons are the only ones a student sees at 32px on a phone with
 * nothing else beside them, and a 2px hairline outline at that size reads as a
 * settings menu. The reference bar draws its five as flat, chunky, CENTRE-FILLED
 * cut-outs, each in its own colour, and it keeps that colour whether or not the
 * item is the active one. Round one of this piece wrote that intent into this
 * comment ("a flat shape in the tab's own colour") and then drew every layer in
 * `currentColor`, so the shipped bar was four hairlines in one grey. The colour
 * is real now and lives in theme.css as `--tab-hue-*`.
 *
 * THREE KINDS OF LAYER, which is the whole construction:
 *
 *   line   a thick round-capped stroke in the hue, or in the tint when it is
 *          the highlight laid back over one. The track, the arrow shaft
 *   body   a flat fill in the hue's 22 percent tint, outlined in the hue. This
 *          is what makes a shape read as a cut-out pressed onto the page, per
 *          sticker rule 3, and the tint under the outline is what stops it
 *          reading as a solid blob
 *   ink    a flat fill in the hue at full strength, no outline. Used where one
 *          shape sits ON another and has to occlude it: the head over the
 *          shoulders, the arrowhead over the shaft, the card behind the card
 *          in front
 *
 * Layers paint in order, so occlusion is the order and there is no knockout
 * colour to keep in sync with the ground any more. That is why the old `paper`
 * layer is gone: an opaque tint occludes what is behind it by itself, and a
 * knockout that had to guess whether the bar was white or near-black was one
 * more thing to get wrong in a theme nobody screenshotted.
 *
 * The five off-bar ids stay single stroke paths in `currentColor` on purpose.
 * They are drawn in a header tool button, in a list row on the Me tab and
 * beside a course name, all at 20px next to text, where a filled sticker would
 * out-shout the label it is labelling. Same family, different job.
 *
 * No shadow on any of them. Depth here is the outline and the occlusion, per
 * sticker rule 3, and a drop shadow is the thing that language forbids.

     What was here before was a curved electron arrow, which is a fine picture
     of the Mechanism Trainer and the wrong picture of this TAB. The tab is not
     the mechanism trainer; it is the gym, holding Puzzle Sprint, four practice
     modes and the daily mechanism, and an arrow says none of that. Flask plus
     dumbbell says chemistry plus reps in one glance, which is the job.

     Drawn as a conical flask on the left with a filled body, and a compact
     dumbbell on the right: two bells and a bar. The bar is a `line` rather
     than a rectangle so it survives being 20px next to a label, where a thin

  /* THE BLUE NEWSPAPER, docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md, "Header and tabs": "Feed is the
     blue NEWSPAPER". Drawn here in the same three-layer construction as its
     four neighbours rather than reusing FeedIcon.tsx's NewspaperMark, and the
     reason is that the bar draws its icons in the tab's OWN hue while
     NewspaperMark inherits `currentColor` and knocks its print out in
     `var(--card)`. In the bar that would be a grey silhouette beside four
     coloured cut-outs at rest, and on the active chip its knockouts would be
     card-coloured on a lavender ground. NewspaperMark stays exactly where it
     is and keeps its job: it is the cheap glyph a non-bar surface imports
     without pulling the Feed chunk into the entry payload.

     The folded back page is the shape that says "newspaper" rather than
     "document" at 32px, so it is an `ink` slab BEHIND the sheet: an opaque
     fill occludes nothing it should not and needs no knockout colour. The
     print is three marks, not six: a masthead bar, one headline block and two
     column rules. Round one of this glyph drew six and they closed into a
     smudge at bar size. */
