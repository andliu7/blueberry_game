/**
 * The route table. One place that knows what a URL hash means.
 *
 * Hash routing, not path routing, for the reason docs/INHERITED-DECISIONS.md D5
 * records: a static host serves files and rewrites nothing, so "/pathway" 404s
 * on refresh while "#/pathway" never leaves index.html. The sibling repo made
 * the same call for the same reason.
 *
 * Routes are data here and nowhere else. A tab component never reads
 * window.location; it receives what it needs as props from the shell.
 *
 * FIVE TABS, NOT EIGHT AND NOT FOUR. Owner amendment of 2026-08-28, recorded
 * in CLAUDE.md and in docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md §4:
 *
 *   "Four tabs: Path, Train, Cards, Me. The periodic table and the reaction
 *   search are not destinations, they are tools a student reaches for mid
 *   problem, so they live in the header and are reachable from every tab and
 *   from inside a lesson. Courses collapses while there is one course.
 *   Leaderboards, chat and tutor messages go behind a flag until their servers
 *   exist. Nothing is deleted and no link 404s."
 *
 * AMENDED 2026-09-01 at the calibration gate, and the amendment is deliberate
 * rather than a slide: the bar is FIVE. Path, Train, Cards, Feed, Me, in that
 * order. CLAUDE.md's tab section carries the supersession in the owner's own
 * words, docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md ("Header and tabs") makes the five-tab goal
 * images binding on the count, and every committed unit image in
 * docs/reference/design-goals/units/ draws exactly those five in exactly that
 * order. Five is mobile-ui's HARD limit, so this bar now sits on the ceiling
 * and no sixth ever joins without one leaving; owner direction of 2026-09-02
 * is that the one leaving is eventually Train, once its surfaces have a named
 * home, which is a later round's brief and not this one's.
 *
 * Feed's server-backed sections render an honest not-open state until their
 * servers exist, per the flagged-surface rule; its daily quests are derived
 * from the LOCAL journal, so they ship live. That is why Feed is `nav` and not
 * `flagged`: the tab has real content today, and only one section of it waits.
 *
 * So a tab id has a PLACEMENT, and the placement is what the shell reads:
 *
 *   nav        the five in the bar. mobile-ui: five is the hard limit, and
 *              tabs are DESTINATIONS
 *   tool       reachable from the header on every screen, and still a route of
 *              its own so a deep link and a browser back button both work
 *   collapsed  reachable, not in the bar, because one course does not need a
 *              browsing surface. #/courses still resolves and still lists all
 *              six, five of them greyed with an honest coming treatment
 *   flagged    built, off by default, still routable. See app/flags.ts
 *
 * Every id in TabId still parses, which is the half of this that is not a
 * design decision: a link a student already has in their history must land on
 * a page, and a tab we stopped showing is not a reason to serve a 404.
