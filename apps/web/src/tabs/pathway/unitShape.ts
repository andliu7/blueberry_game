/**
 * THE SHAPE OF A UNIT, derived from the map's own structure. Pure: no React,
 * no DOM, so the composition the track draws is testable without a document.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The attempt-2 build authored one fork (u1) and one hub
 * (u3) as hardcoded constants, so eleven of thirteen units rendered as bare
 * winding columns and the critic named it: docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md says the
 * "DIAMOND fork is the DEFAULT UNIT SHAPE (concept node above the fork,
 * branches rejoin at the unit gate)", and a default that ships twice is not a
 * default. So the diamond is DERIVED here, for every unit, from the data the
 * map already carries, and nothing about a unit's shape is authored twice.
 *
 * THE DERIVATION, in the order it runs, and every step is a rule rather than a
 * judgement about one unit:
 *
 *   1. HUB, and it stays RESERVED. The goals reserve the petal flower for
 *      "categories with three or more families (EAS, the acyl ladder)", which
 *      is a two-item list, not a default. HUB_PLANS names exactly those two
 *      and hubPlan.ts explains each choice; a unit not in that table cannot
 *      grow a flower, and a table entry whose nodes have been renamed away
 *      degrades to the winding column rather than drawing a bald one.
 *   2. DIAMOND, the default. The fork sits at the END of the unit so the
 *      arms have somewhere to rejoin: the unit gate is drawn directly beneath
 *      them, in the same section, which is the whole of the attempt-2 rejoin
 *      bug (its gate was the NEXT unit's, about 700px down the page, so the
 *      arms closed across a banner and a side-quest block).
 *      The concept is the unit's own CONCEPT BEAT where one is in reach: a
 *      beat is MCQ, sort or ladder work, which is recognition and ranking,
 *      which is what a concept node is. Failing that it is the third node
 *      from the end, which is the plain positional reading of the committed
 *      diamond. The arms are what follows the concept, and if only one node
 *      follows it the node BEFORE the concept is pulled up into the other
 *      arm: that is how u1 derives the fork a human would author for it
 *      (kinetic-vs-thermodynamic above, 1,2-vs-1,4 and X2 addition either
 *      side), without u1 being named anywhere in this file.
 *   3. SIDE LOOPS. Every `branch` node in the map is, in the map's own words,
 *      an "optional side quest", which is the goals' dimmed side loop. They
 *      are interleaved through the column so each detour carries one or two
 *      chips and the spine reads as continuous past them, rather than piling
 *      into a flow-wrapped list of dashed pills (the attempt-2 defect).
 *      A unit with NO spine at all is all enrichment, so its branches ARE its
 *      track and ride the main lane: a detour needs a road to leave.
 *   4. VIDEO HOOK. The seventh node type in blueberry_spec-node-types, and it
 *      had no vocabulary at all before this build. See VIDEO_HOOK below for
 *      what the badge does and does not claim.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE DECIDES UNLOCK. Shape is presentation; state comes from
 * pathwayState.ts, where only unit gates lock, so both arms of every diamond
 * are genuinely open at once and the fork is the unlock policy made visible
 * rather than a decoration over a chain (docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md, 2026-09-01).

 * ("roughly one minute per concept, embedded in lessons").
 *
 * What it claims is that this node is the unit's video slot, which is a

 * exists: no video is authored yet, and lessons must stand without one per
 * CLAUDE.md, which is what LessonVideo.tsx already renders honestly. This is
 * flagged in the build report rather than settled here, because "draw the
 * seventh type" and "never promise an asset that is missing" are two rules
