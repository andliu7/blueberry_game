/**
 * The pathway's backdrop: one continuous landscape that scrolls with the path.
 *
 * Not a tiled texture and not wallpaper. terrain.ts explains the motif; this
 * file is the drawing and the one animation frame that moves it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ALL INSIDE ONE <svg>. Three reasons, in order of weight. A landscape
 * is artwork rather than chrome, and the sticker language's rules about borders,
 * radii and fills are about controls and cards, so drawing it as a stack of divs
 * would put a dozen borderless rectangles in front of an audit that is right to
 * ask about them. Masks, stroke-dashoffset draws and mirrored curves are native
 * here and awkward anywhere else. And one element means one paint layer for the
 * whole backdrop instead of seven.
 *
 * THE LAYERS, back to front, with the rate each moves at relative to the page.
 * layered-motion's stack, trimmed to what "simple and plain" leaves standing:
 *
 *   shade          0.04   the wash either side of the paper. Holds the lens
 *   paper          0.04   THE MEANING LAYER. The ribbon's width IS the energy
 *                         profile, and its edge is drawn from the unit's data
 *   props          0.14   an Erlenmeyer on the far shelf at each checkpoint
 *   (the track)    1.00   real DOM, not in here
 *
 * Every one of those is a transform on a <g>, written in ONE requestAnimationFrame
 * from ONE cached scroll value, per layered-motion's rule. Nothing here animates
 * a layout property and nothing here takes a pointer event.
 *
 * THE LENS. The shade layer is masked, and the mask carries two holes: one that
 * follows the pointer, and one anchored on the node the student is meant to tap
 * next. It used to mask a fog layer of its own; the fog is gone with the
 * hillsides it sat on, and the same effect now costs one layer instead of two. The second is not a nicety. Touch has no hover, so a lens bound only
 * to a pointer is invisible on the device most of this product is used on, and
 * layered-motion is explicit that a hover revealed thing needs a non hover path.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION renders a settled frame: the curve fully drawn, every layer at
 * rest, the lens parked on the current node. A real frame of the design, never
 * an empty box.

   * BACKGROUND DOCTRINE: "the environment is COMPOSED, never scattered". A

   * top-left challenge chip and a second cloud is clipped in half by the Unit
   * 3 signpost's violet rule". The composition is therefore decided against
   * the real layout rather than against an assumption about it: the boxes
   * below are what the browser actually laid out.
   *
   * TEXT is absolute. A node's name card, a unit signpost and the gate carry
   * reading, and terrain.ts's header explains at length why nothing in the
   * landscape may sit under reading: the contrast audit climbs CSS boxes, an
   * SVG mark under a text box is not that box's ancestor, so a pair the audit
   * reports as passing could be composed on something else entirely. A prop

   *
   * CHIPS are not, and that is the change of 2026-09-04. A chip is an OPAQUE
   * disc drawn above the whole scene, so an outlined watermark passing behind
   * one is occluded, not clipped: it shows either side of the chip, which is
   * what the per-unit designs draw (unit04's watermarks run behind the label
   * column). Dropping on chips as well was measured to be what starved the
   * landscape: on a 390pt phone the column plus its wind reaches from 0.11 to
   * 0.89 of the scene, so nearly every flank placement met a chip somewhere
   * and the whole strip vanished. The FILLED prop is the exception and keeps
   * the old rule, because a white cloud meeting a chip reads as two stickers
   * colliding rather than as weather behind a button.

        edge that read as a misregistered plate, and they cost the node labels
        horizontal room they wanted. That colour was not a taste failure, it was

        dark and warm.

        The lavender turn removes the constraint by removing the fill. The ground
        IS the page now, the channel is a strip of the card's own cream running
        down it, and the shape that used to be a hillside is a soft shade beside
        the paper rather than a body of land. The ribbon carries a permanent
        hairline edge for the same arithmetic every card in the app now carries
        one: cream on lavender is 1.96:1 and a boundary needs 3:1, so the edge is
        what identifies the shape and the fill rides on it (the contrast audit

          THE TERRACES, which are also the descending energy bands.
          docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md asks the background for "terraced hills stepping
          down ... a gentle descending energy-band gradient" and for the energy
          metaphor where "each unit ends lower than it began". Each plate is
          drawn OVER the one before it, so the only visible edge is its own
          rolling top: the step IS the drop in energy, with one mechanism
          rather than three stacked layers. Each plate runs far past its own
          span so the next plate's fill is what ends it.

          THE PITCH IS CONSTANT AND THE LADDER IS THE TRACK'S, NOT THE UNIT'S,
          which is the "does not flow" half of the owner's note. A plate that
          started and stopped with its unit put a hard horizontal every time
          the banner passed; a plate every 230px puts one wherever it lands,
          and the boundary is crossed by whichever plate happens to straddle
          it. Nothing about the unit is lost: terraceProfile still reads the
          unit index, so the SKYLINE changes character at the boundary while
          the ladder carrying it does not stop.

          THE RIDGE IS DRAWN INSIDE THIS LOOP, immediately after the plate its
          summit stands in, and terrain.ts's Ridge comment explains why it
          cannot be a layer of its own: every plate's body runs 600px past its
          own bottom, so a silhouette drawn before all of them is painted over
          by all of them. Drawn here it rises above the NEXT plate's edge and

                   is the cut between them rather than a contour line ruled on

          A checkpoint is the activation barrier between two wells, so the
          landscape rises where the unit gate stands: that is the goals'
          energy metaphor and it is worth keeping. What is not worth keeping
          is how it was drawn. It was a 2.5px dashed brown stroke arcing
          across the page, which on a flat cream ground was the single most
          visible mark in the whole landscape and read as a contour line on a
          map, not as a hill. blueberry_artkit-env-backdrop draws its hills as
          ROUNDED FILLED SILHOUETTES stepping down, with no outline anywhere.

          It moves onto the ground layer with the terraces, so props and the
          trail pass in FRONT of the hill rather than being covered by it, and
          it is filled in the deepest terrace value so the crest reads as the
          same land the plates are cut from.

        THE PROPS, hung off the TERRACE LADDER rather than off the units.

        This is the other half of "does not flow". Two to three props per
        230px plate, on flanks that alternate plate to plate, means the eye
        crosses the track on the way down and the arrangement never restarts
        at a banner. sceneProps.propsForBand is the whole table and it takes
        the plate's index and the unit's character, so the RHYTHM is the

        watermark family stands on the flanks and how often glassware and
        weather appear, without a single new drawing.

        SIZE COMES FROM ONE PLACE. drawScale and propExtent are both in
        sceneProps, so the size a prop is drawn at and the size the keep-out

        wide and drawn 54, which is the "small" half of the owner's note.

              WHAT A PROP MUST CLEAR, and it is not the same list for all of
              them, because the reasons are not the same.

              THE TRAIL IS ABSOLUTE FOR EVERY PROP. Pixel verdict of
              2026-09-04: "keep watermarks OFF the trail; one currently sits
              directly under it". The ribbon is a LINE OVER the ground, not a
              surface: a skeleton under it shows either side and reads as a
              smudge on the road. This rule is new; nothing said it before.

              A FILLED PROP additionally clears the chips and the reading.
              Two stickers meeting is a collision whichever is on top, and a
              white cloud behind a chip reads as a rendering fault.

              AN OUTLINED WATERMARK MAY PASS BEHIND OPAQUE THINGS, and the
              name cards are opaque: `background: var(--card)` with no alpha.
              So is a chip. The old rule kept watermarks off the CARDS as well
              as the trail, and the reason recorded for it does not survive
              contact with an opaque card: terrain.ts's worry is that "an SVG
              mark under a text box is not that box's ancestor, so a pair the
              audit reports as passing could be composed on something else",
              which is a hazard only where the text sits on the MARK. Text on
              an opaque card is composed on the card, and the card's own
              contrast is measured where it is composed.

              It is also what starved the landscape, and that was measured:
              with the cards in every outlined prop's keep-out list, a 390pt
              phone frame carried TWO props. The reference frame carries a
              gate, two clouds, two flasks, three skeletons and boulders. A
              phone that draws a full-width winding column and a card on every
              node has no open ground left to be strict with.

          `.path-channel` was `fill: var(--card)`, which the warm cream regime
          resolves to #ffffff: the paper the entire track was printed on was
          PURE WHITE on a cream page, edged with a hard 2px slate rule each
          side, so the tab read as a white document taped onto cream with two
          vertical rules the committed reference has nowhere. The critic
          measured it live at 390px (body rgb(251,243,230), channel
          rgb(255,255,255), cream surviving only in ~25px flanks) and every
          layer below (15 terraces, 23 marks, 2 grounds, 2 props) was painted
          and then covered by it.

          The channel was not a mistake when it was written: under the lavender
          turn the page ground was #a3aee2 and body copy genuinely could not
          sit on it, so a cream strip under the labels was load bearing. The
          warm cream regime (DESIGN-TOKENS.md, Supersession 2026-09-01) makes
          the PAGE the cream, so every ink on this track was already derived
          against the surface it now sits on, and the strip has nothing left to
          do but hide the landscape. terrain.ts keeps channelPath and
          boundaryPath, and their tests keep passing, because the geometry was
          never the thing that was wrong.

        compositor scrolling.

        layer (the S2 round recorded what a full-height layer does to the
