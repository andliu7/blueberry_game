/**
 * The pathway: the winding track through the course, rebuilt to
 * docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md (owner verdicts 2026-09-01). The committed reference
 * for the whole tab is docs/reference/design-goals/
 * blueberry_r7-compiled-v2_1788288474.png, the five node states are
 * blueberry_r7-states-sheet_1788288485.png, and the diamond fork geometry is
 * blueberry_branch-diamond_1788284291.png.
 *
 * WHERE THE SHAPE COMES FROM. TOPICS in the curriculum package carries the
 * course's topics; the one open course renders the owner's map
 * (demo/pathwayMap.ts) instead. Either way the graph is content, read
 * straight from data, never authored twice.
 *
 * WHERE THE STATE COMES FROM, and the rule that governs it. Unlock state is
 * progress, enforced server side per CLAUDE.md; the client renders it and
 * never decides it. UNIT GATES ARE THE ONLY LOCKS, owner ruling 2026-09-01:
 * within a unit every node is freely orderable, so no mid-unit node ever
 * renders locked. The rule lives in topicPathway.ts for the topic view and
 * pathwayState.ts for the map view, the same model in both vocabularies; the
 * per-node prerequisite gates the earlier build drew are retired, and
 * test/pathwayUnlock.test.ts asserts the retirement positively.
 *
 * THE LOOK. Periwinkle 3D pressable chips (the --chip-* family), all one
 * size, five states per the committed sheet; a drawn winding trail that
 * PathScene derives from where the nodes actually landed; the DIAMOND FORK
 * as the default unit shape, derived per unit in unitShape.ts, with the
 * concept above the split and the arms rejoining at that unit'''s OWN
 * double-dagger gate; enrichment on dimmed side loops flying the application
 * flag; the petal hub on the two units the goals reserve it for; and the F1
 * track-map scrollbar riding its thin energy axis, drawing the unit'''s real
 * shape because it reads the same layout the track just drew. The button
 * styling and the pitch live in pathway.css beside this file.
 *
 * WHERE A PRESS GOES. Node, then price, in that order: a chip opens the NODE
 * SHEET (src/pathway-sheet, Practice with its pips, Challenge with its
 * stopwatch and double dagger, a hamburger to the guidebook), and the sheet'''s
 * START opens the Charge sheet. docs/ECONOMY.md wants the price named at the
 * door; the door is the sheet.

 * accessible name says "Opens when the unit before it is done". So the state
 * is carried by the TREATMENT plus a real sentence rather than by a stamp
 * over the content, which is what the clause asks for and is also the
 * stronger accessibility answer: a padlock is a picture nobody announces.

 * check is dark progress ink, not white, because white on the goal green
 * measures 1.76:1, under the 3.0 graphics floor; measured, not assumed, per
 * the fill-only rule. Review is the one state the sheet does not draw (it is
 * this app's spaced-repetition seam) and takes a circular refresh arrow in

 * dimmed side loop, which is the one place the layout says so. `enrichment`
 * is the row's own `dim`, passed in rather than inferred, because the layout
 * is what decides which nodes are detours.
 *
 * What the branch nodes on the fork's arms get instead is the motif for the
 * work they hold, which is what the goals' "one motif per node" asks for:

 * background, that makes it confusing". They were right, and the cause was one
 * channel doing two jobs. `enrichment` used to override the kind and stamp a
 * flag, so a whole unit of ordinary mechanism and concept lessons drew as
 * identical flags and the motif stopped telling a student anything about the
 * work. Optional is already carried by the dimmed treatment the goals give a
 * side loop, which is a second, independent channel. So the motif now always
 * reports the kind, exactly as DESIGN-GOALS asks: colour says state, badge says
 * kind, dimming says optional, and no one of them is overloaded.
 *
 * EVERY NODE CARRIES ITS MOTIF, AND THIS FUNCTION NEVER RETURNS NULL.
 * docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md, owner 2026-09-04: "A node with no playable content
 * still shows what KIND it will be rather than an empty face, because an
 * empty chip reads as broken rather than as unauthored. Queued authoring
 * keeps its motif and takes the dashed treatment." It used to return null for
 * an unauthored node, and the pixel critic counted the cost: four of the
 * eight faces on the first screen were blank.
 *
 * An unauthored node still knows what it IS, because its kind is authored
 * even when its content is not, and the KIND is the honest thing to report:
 *
 *   gate, boss   a checkpoint. The stopwatch, which is what unit 2 is: six
 *                nodes of kind "gate", none of them a lesson
 *   branch       a named reaction off the spine. The curved arrow, because a

 *   spine        a lesson. The lightbulb, the neutral "there is something to
 *                learn here"
 *
 * NONE of those says optional, which is the rule this function was written
 * for and which the first draft of this change broke: mapping branch to the
 * application FLAG would have made "is this on the exam" a property of the
 * motif again. Optional stays the dimmed treatment's job.

/**
 * The unit gate, redrawn against blueberry_spec-node-types and the owner's
 * 2026-09-03 ruling on the gate.
 *
 * THE ARCH IS A FILLED SILHOUETTE, and that is the fix for the dented
 * horseshoe a critic captured on Units 2 and 4: "the arch has a V-shaped
 * notch cut into its apex where the two branch trails converge and pass
 * through it". The arch used to be two STROKED arcs with `fill: none`, so the
 * ribbon behind it showed through its own mouth and the two arms converging
 * on it drew a V across the crown. blueberry_spec-node-types draws a solid
 * unbroken grey band, so the arch is now one closed path with a fill and a
 * keyline: nothing can show through it, and the silhouette is the clean bell
 * the spec draws. Rounded joins, so the feet are finished ends rather than
 * cut-off legs that read as a continuation of the road.
 *
 * THE DOUBLE DAGGER IS SUNKEN, NOT HUNG. docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md: "one clean
 * mark, sunken, violet family, no ornament", and "the glyph is a proper
 * double dagger drawn once". The build hung it in a white circular badge off
 * the arch's shoulder, which is an ornament by that clause's own wording, and
 * blueberry_spec-node-types draws the mark directly on the arch with nothing
 * behind it. So the mark is drawn INSIDE the arch's own svg, in the arch's
 * darker tone, with the same two-layer cut the node motifs use: the same
 * engraving language, applied to the one node type that is not a chip. It
 * being in the same svg is also what stops it drifting off the shoulder at
 * any width.
 *
 * IT IS VECTOR, never the &#8225; character. A text glyph is a different
 * shape in every font a platform might fall back to, and CLAUDE.md's icon
 * rule ("ICONS ARE SVG, NEVER RASTER, NEVER EMOJI") is about exactly this
 * kind of drift. One stem, two crossbars, drawn once.
 *
 * THE ARCH IS GREY IN EVERY STATE, per the spec: grey is what says "this is a
 * boundary, not a lesson". A passed gate does not turn green, because green
 * says "you moved" and a boundary has not moved. `passed` changes the
 * accessible name, which is the honest place for a claim about progress.
 *
 * The arch keeps `data-trail="main"`: it IS the rejoin anchor a diamond's two
 * arms close on, which is the committed geometry in blueberry_branch-diamond.

    THE ARCH, REDRAWN AGAINST THE ADOPTED DESIGN, 2026-09-04.

    WHAT unit02-path.jpg ACTUALLY DRAWS, read off the image at 6x with
    measurements/_probe-ref-card.mjs and scanned for its width with
    measurements/_probe-ref-gate.mjs: a wide half-round arch in the NODE
    PERIWINKLE, built from TWO CONCENTRIC BANDS (a thick light one outside, a
    thinner deeper one inside), short flat feet standing on the ground, a
    large dark glyph centred in the OPENING under the crown, and no text
    anywhere near it.

    THE SIZE IS MEASURED. The reference arch is 135 pixels wide on a 594 pixel
    phone screen, which is 22.7 percent of screen width. Ours painted at about
    16 percent, inside an 84px box that was mostly padding. The band now spans
    its own box, and the box is 100px on a 390pt phone: 25.6 percent, which is
    the reference plus the hair the drop shadow needs.

    IT IS PERIWINKLE NOW AND IT WAS GREY. The grey came from
    blueberry_spec-node-types ("grey says boundary, not lesson"), which the
    owner's 2026-09-03 ruling superseded by name: "THE UNIT GATE is the simple
    arch of unit02-path.jpg". That arch is the node blue. Reported as the
    divergence it is rather than resolved silently.

    Two closed paths rather than one, because two bands is what the image
    draws. Each is a half annulus: out along the ground, up the outside, over
    the crown, down to the ground, then back up the inside.

    OPENING, on the ground the trail runs through, centred on the trail's own
    x, at roughly a sixth of the arch's width. That is what this is now.

 *
 * THE CYCLE RESTARTS AT ITS PEAK ON EVERY UNIT, and that is this round's fix
 * for the straight spine at a unit boundary. A critic measured it: "at every
 * unit boundary the build draws a dead-straight vertical spine ... the trail
 * runs unbent for roughly 450 CSS px from the gate arch, straight through the
 * unit banner and out the bottom", against the goals' "Winding trail, never a
 * straight central spine".
 *
 * The cause was arithmetic rather than art. A unit's gate arch sits on the
 * CENTRELINE (it is the rejoin anchor, so it has to), and the next unit's
 * first node then took whatever the running index handed it, which is 0.85 of
 * a step as often as not: 66px of sideways travel over the arch, the signpost
 * and the row pitch is a line, not a turn.
 *
 * So each unit starts its own cycle on a PEAK step, and consecutive units
 * start on opposite peaks (index 1 gives +1.7, index 3 gives -1.7). The road
 * leaving an arch therefore swings 133px to one side immediately and the next
 * unit swings the other way, so a boundary is the sharpest turn on the track
 * instead of its one straight run. The signpost shrinking from a 150px slab to
 * a rule takes about 120px out of the same gap, which is the other half of it.
 *
 * The alternation is a function of the unit's ORDINAL, so it is deterministic
 * and identical for the track and the pill, which is the whole reason both
 * read this one plan.

                THE UNIT SIGNPOST IS A THIN VIOLET RULE ACROSS THE ROAD with
                one short caps line over it, which is what
                blueberry_branch-diamond draws: a hairline the width of the
                column, the word "EAS" small and violet above it, occupying
                about four percent of the screen.

                What the build drew was the slab its own comment claimed it
                had replaced: a full-width cream card with a 2px border and
                two lines of 17px semibold text, about 150 CSS px tall, the
                largest single element on the screen and larger than any node.
                A critic measured it and named it, and the measurement is the
                point: a chapter heading that out-weighs the button a student
                is meant to press has inverted the composition.

                THE NAMING SURVIVES THE SHRINK, and that matters because
                naming is what the S3 judge picked this track for. The number
                and the name still both render, in full, at every width; they
                are one small letterspaced caps line now instead of two 17px
                semibold ones. The unit's name is also carried at full size in
                the fast-travel overlay, which is where a reader goes when
                they are looking for a unit rather than walking past one.

                The tag is PLATED and the rule deliberately is not: a road
                crossing a signpost's rule is a junction and reads as one, and
                a road crossing a letterform is damage.

                No committed goal image contains a checkpoint block. The build
                invented one: an outlined rectangle holding a dashed brown arc
                and a stack of white 170-by-44 TEXT PILLS, beside 76-by-66
                chips. That breaks the goals twice over, because the path
                vocabulary has exactly one shape for an item on the path (the
                periwinkle 3D chip) and because "all nodes the same size" is a
                clause, not a preference, and a 170pt pill is not the size of a
                66pt chip.

                A checkpoint question is a challenge, so it is drawn as the
                CHALLENGE node type the spec sheet already has.

                AND IT IS ON THE ROAD. The chips used to sit in a flow-wrapped
                block with `lane="off"`, so unit 2's five challenges rendered
                as a 3-then-2 lattice and four of the five had no connector to
                anything. That failed two clauses at once: a lattice is not
                one of the three shapes the branch vocabulary has, and "THE
                TRAIL IS CODE, ALWAYS ... a trail that visibly diverges from
                its nodes is a failing bug". They are spine rows now, riding
                the same wind cycle as every other node, so the road winds out
                of the fork's rejoin, through the checkpoint, and into the
                arch, and the trail reaches all of them by construction.
