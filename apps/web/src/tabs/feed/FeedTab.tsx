/**
 * The Feed tab. Two sections, per docs/DESIGN-GOALS.md ("Ours, not
 * Duolingo's") and the committed reference blueberry_r7-feed-v2_1788288479.png:
 *
 *   DAILY QUESTS   three rows on WHITE cards, each led by its own large motif
 *                  (a flask that fills, the cartoon flame, a fan of cards), a
 *                  pale track carrying a GREEN fill that runs into a chest, and
 *                  a number beside the bar so the bar is never the only carrier
 *                  of the reading. Everything derives from the LOCAL journal
 *                  through feedModel.ts; nothing is invented.
 *
 *   LAB MATES      other people's activity, which only a server can know. It
 *                  renders honestly not open, naming the Phase 6 server it
 *                  waits on: the SHAPE is drawn (berry avatars in three berry
 *                  colours, the toast-a-flask cheer at the end of each row) so
 *                  the student sees what this becomes, and no row pretends to
 *                  be a person.
 *
 * WHAT ATTEMPT 2 CHANGED, every line of it measured against the committed
 * image by a critic rather than argued here:
 *
 *   THE GREEN IS THE FILL, NOT THE TRACK. The build had a pale GREEN track
 *   under a green fill, so an untouched quest was the greenest thing on the
 *   screen and green read as "nothing done". That inverts DESIGN-GOALS line 17
 *   ("Green says you moved"). The track is a pale neutral now and the only
 *   green on a bar is the part that was earned.
 *
 *   THE CARDS ARE WHITE ON THE CREAM PAGE, separated by VALUE, with a soft
 *   warm hairline instead of the 2 px dark slate --border the build drew. The
 *   image never draws a dark outline round these; the white is the separation.
 *
 *   THREE MOTIFS, NOT THREE COPIES OF ONE. See QuestMotif in feedModel.ts.
 *   At 56 px they are the row's colour anchor, which is what the image's icon
 *   column does and what an outlined 46 px monochrome flask did not.
 *
 *   THE CHEER IS A REAL CONTROL. It was an aria-hidden decoration, so the
 *   whole surface contained zero <button> elements: no press acknowledgement,
 *   no disabled state, no 44 px target. The honest not-open treatment of an
 *   action is a DISABLED control, not the absence of one, so it is a real
 *   disabled button carrying the reason in its accessible name.
 *
 * WHY THE QUEST BAR'S FILL IS THE GOAL GREEN AND WHY IT IS FILL ONLY.
 * DESIGN-GOALS: light green is the progress semantic everywhere, filled bars
 * included, and it is FILL ONLY. The fill here carries no text and no mark;
 * the reading beside it is the page's own ink on the card, and the track
 * carries the boundary ring, so the green is never the thing a reader has to
 * resolve at a floor it fails.
 *
 * THE CLOCK. The model takes `now` as an argument (LOG.md: the clock is part
 * of the surface). This component reads it once per journal change, so a
 * finished lesson moves the bars on return to the tab, and no timer redraws a
 * static screen.
 *
 * THE FEED IS NOT IN THE TAB BAR YET, and it is the one must-fix on this
 * surface this piece cannot land: `ALL_TABS` in app/routes.ts has no `feed`
 * entry, so `#/feed` does not parse and this component is unreachable in the
 * product. routes.ts and Shell.tsx are the INTEGRATOR's files. What they need
 * is exported below as FEED_TAB_REQUEST rather than described in a report.
 *
 * No mascot on this tab. Bloom appears once per screen where he appears at
 * all (sticker rule 10), and the berry avatars here are deliberately OTHER
 * berries, drawn small and flat, never the imported mark.
