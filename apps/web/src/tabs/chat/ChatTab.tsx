/**
 * AI chat, the Tier 3 tail. The server that meters it is Phase 7.
 *
 * What is real here: the composer, the message list, the press contract, and
 * the explanation of where this sits in the three tiers. What is not: any
 * model call. Send is disabled with a reason rather than hidden, because a
 * student who finds the tab should learn what it will do, not wonder why it
 * is empty.

          Most feedback in Blueberry is written by a person and served instantly: every named
          cause in the trainer and every anticipated wrong answer in a lesson has authored copy.
          This chat is the third tier, for the attempt nothing matched. It sees your current
          problem, it is metered per day, and it arrives with the server in Phase 7.
