/**
 * Me: the account tab, and the fourth of the four.
 *
 * WHAT A FOURTH TAB IS FOR. mobile-ui's rule is one screen one job, and the
 * job of this one is everything that is about the STUDENT rather than about
 * the chemistry: who they are, which course they are on, how the app is set up
 * for them, and what is not open yet. Every one of those used to be somewhere
 * else or nowhere at all, which is how an eight tab bar happens: each thing
 * that had no home got a tab.
 *
 * THIS IS WHERE THEME AND LANGUAGE LIVE NOW. They were two ghost buttons in
 * the header, and the header's left half is worth more to the two tools a
 * student reaches for mid problem. A colour scheme is chosen once; a periodic
 * table is opened in the middle of an EAS problem. See Shell.tsx for the trade.
 *
 * THE FLAGGED SURFACES ARE LISTED, NOT HIDDEN. Owner amendment of 2026-08-28:
 * leaderboards, chat and tutor messaging go behind a flag "rather than being
 * deleted". A student who heard the product has leaderboards and finds no
 * mention of them anywhere concludes the product lied; a student who finds a
 * row saying what it is waiting on concludes it is being built. So the rows are
 * here, they say when, and they are links, because their routes resolve.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS AN ENTITLEMENT. CLAUDE.md: anything that gates access is
 * enforced server side. This screen reads a client flag to decide what to draw
 * and reads a derived snapshot to show numbers; it decides nothing.
