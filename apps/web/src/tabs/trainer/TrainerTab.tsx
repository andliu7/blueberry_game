/**
 * The Mechanism Trainer tab. The crown jewel, wired end to end for one step:
 * the Phase 2 interaction machine drives the Phase 4 scene, the shell grades
 * (see grade.ts for exactly how far that honesty extends), packages/feedback
 * supplies the words, and the Phase 4 animation plays the step back when it
 * is right.
 *
 * Two modes on one canvas:
 *   draw   DrawCanvas, fed by the interaction store
 *   play   MoleculeSvg or the lazy Scene3D, driven by useStepProgress
 *
 * The store is created once per step in useMemo and read with
 * useSyncExternalStore, the same pattern the interaction package documents on
 * store.ts. Notices and effects arrive through callbacks; haptics go to
 * navigator.vibrate where it exists, which is the one platform effect the
 * package leaves to the shell.
 *
 * Failure animations, per BUILD-PROMPT.md Phase 5, all without red:
 *   invalid        every drawn arrow snaps back elastically, then the draft
 *                  resets, and the Tier 1 copy for the named cause renders
 *   not requested  legal arrows that are not the step: the leaving group
 *                  that the drawing left in place wobbles and stays, and the
 *                  result is named out loud
 *   incomplete     no animation; the strip says how many arrows remain
 *
 * The URL flags from Phase 4 still work here (?auto=1 loops playback for the
 * frame scripts, ?renderer=3d, ?stats=1), because the measurement scripts
 * load the default route and this is it.
