/**
 * The interactive canvas: the step's `from` state with the student's arrows
 * over it, fed by pointer events into the interaction store.
 *
 * Why this is not MoleculeSvg with extra props: MoleculeSvg is one of two
 * implementations of the renderer contract (2D and 3D), and that contract is
 * a pure projection of a precomputed scene plus a progress number. Teaching
 * it about armed sources, in flight guides and bond handles would push the
 * same props into the 3D renderer, where they mean nothing. So the draw mode
 * is its own SVG that shares the scene, the pixel scale, the element colours
 * and the depth glyphs (render/svg/depth.tsx), and the playback after a
 * correct answer hands off to MoleculeSvg.
 *
 * Pointer plumbing, the one place DOM types appear: a PointerEvent becomes a
 * PointerInput at this boundary. Coordinates go through the SVG's screen CTM
 * so the point is in the same pixel space the targets were computed in,
 * whatever size the canvas renders at. touch-action: none is palm rejection
 * for pen and lets a drag start without the page scrolling. setPointerCapture
 * keeps move and up events coming after the pointer leaves the SVG.
 *
 * MOVING A MOLECULE. The interaction machine has no movement threshold on
 * purpose (machine.ts, "why movement distance is not used to classify
 * anything"), so picking a species up and carrying it cannot be one of its
 * rules. It is this file's: a press the hit tester resolves to an atom BODY,
 * while nothing is armed, is a drag candidate. Once the pointer travels past
 * DRAG_START_PX the canvas owns the gesture: the species offset follows the
 * pointer and the machine is sent nothing until release, when it receives a
 * pointerUp at the original press point so R2 sees a plain tap and the
 * session closes. The press itself still went to the machine at pointer down
 * (R1 revealed the lone pairs, which is the acknowledgement), so a carry is
 * a tap with a journey in the middle, exactly the shape the machine expects.
 *
 * The attachments lag. Atoms move with the pointer; the bonds, hydrogen arcs
 * and lone pair dots of that species sit in a second group whose transform
 * has a 120 ms overshoot transition. Every move retargets it, so they trail
 * and then settle when the hand stops. Transform only, so the compositor
 * does the work; reduced motion drops the transition and they move as one.
 *
 * Lone pairs render for revealed atoms (tap an atom to reveal, which is the
 * machine's rule, not this file's), bond end handles render on every bond,
 * and between-atom sites render only while a source is armed.
