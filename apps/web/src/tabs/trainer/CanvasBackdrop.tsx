/**
 * The water behind the molecules, and the reason the two modes look different
 * before a student has read a single word.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The trainer plays three kinds of thing on one canvas and
 * they were visually identical: a mechanism, a resonance hunt, and the step
 * where a resonance form opens the site the nucleophile then attacks. Owner
 * direction 2026-08-28: make them differ at a glance, keep it related to the
 * chemistry, and use water, because that is where most of this chemistry
 * happens.
 *
 * THE VISUAL RULE, and it is a chemistry argument rather than a taste one:
 *
 *   mechanism   one direction. Electrons go SOMEWHERE. Aqua, a current with a
 *               consistent drift, caustic light sheared the way it travels.
 *   resonance   no direction at all. NOTHING MOVES: the contributing forms are
 *               one thing drawn two ways. Violet, still water, and ripples that
 *               appear only where the student touches, because the movement is
 *               the reader's attention rather than the molecule's.
 *   hybrid      violet resolving into aqua, left to right. The resonance form
 *               exposes the charge and the attack follows it. This is the
 *               carbonyl the owner described: the pi bond shifts onto oxygen,
 *               the carbon goes positive, and something negative comes in.
 *
 * WHY NOT A VIDEO. A looping video would spend the game route's 400 KB initial
 * payload budget and fight the 60 fps row in CLAUDE.md's budgets table. These
 * are three WebP plates totalling 26 KB, served from public/ so they never
 * enter the JS bundle, with the motion added in CSS on transform and opacity
 * only, which keeps it on the compositor.
 *
 * WHY THIS CANNOT BREAK DRAWING, which is the thing worth being careful about.
 * The backdrop is `pointer-events: none` throughout, so it can never take a
 * pointer the arrow machine wanted. It learns about taps from a listener that
 * is passive and non capturing and calls neither preventDefault nor
 * stopPropagation: it watches, and the canvas underneath behaves exactly as it
 * did before this file existed.
